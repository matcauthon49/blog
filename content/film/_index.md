# film

I write about movies. A good compilation of my opinions on movies can be found on my [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/idontplaytetris/) (warning: TMI). Some of my professional writings are attached below; I will update as bylines appear.

## other work

I passively partake in film-related efforts and activities. Among other things, I am interested in [lost media](https://lostmediawiki.com/Home) and [footage archival](https://www.historicfilms.com).

1. *Death Ray on Coral Island* (dir. Hongmei Zhang, 1980), was the first science fiction film made in China. Unfortunately, no subtitles are available for this film. Along with a few friends, I was able to [subtitle this film and make it available in English for the first time](../posts/deathrayoncoralisland).
