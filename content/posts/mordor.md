I have had a minor bout of knee pain, which is surprising—I have been at ACL recovery quite dedicatedly, and my leg muscles are stronger than ever. I suspect it may have something to do with the amount of walking I do. I walk aimlessly very much. Sometimes I listen to music, which supplements the walk with some amount of purpose; it’s like walking around with a backpack, for instance, or eating an apple. Whenever I am procrastinating, I take a walk.

I do not consider this a worrying tendency, but it is one I resort to an unfortunate amount. Presumably it is Nietzsche himself who has planted this mechanism inside my head. From his *Maxims and Arrows*:

> 32. *On ne peut penser et ecrire qu'assis* [One cannot think and write except when seated] (G. Flaubert). There I have caught you, nihilist! The sedentary life is the very sin against the Holy Spirit. Only thoughts reached by walking have value.

It seems that Flaubert is the one who is right this time. Even the man himself can be usurped occasionally.

I only really began walking sometime during the COVID lockdown in 2020, when I resorted to taking walks on the treadmill to maintain some illusion of health. Walking on a treadmill is a frustrating exercise. The uniformity by which it comes is unnatural—it feels alien and imprisoning, and you cannot observe the changing scenery, either. 

There are really a lot of things I disliked about this experience. But more than anything it was the mechanization of this activity which put me at unease; there was so much to just going on a walk that was reduced to an overwhelming bunch of numbers. Apparently it was important for me to know the precise duration of my walk down to the second, among other things. I suppose the point is that the utility it afforded in terms of quantifying your statistics led naturally to improvement—progressive overload, you know, that sort of thing. So you could improve on the activity.
