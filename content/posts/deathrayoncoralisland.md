**TL;DR — I have managed to track down a copy of this film, translated it and published full English subtitles for free online.**

珊瑚岛上的死光 (pinyin: shanhu dao shang de shi guang) — known in English as “Death Ray on Coral Island” (dir. Hongmei Zhang, 1980) was the first science fiction film made in post-1949 China, as part of a brief golden age of Chinese science fiction under the early years of Deng Xiaoping. It was adapted from a short story of the same name authored by Tong Enzheng, the first-ever science fiction story published in China’s official literary magazine “Renmin wenxue” (available <a href="https://archive.org/details/shanhudaoshangde0000unse/">here</a>).

As far as I am aware, the only ever English translation of the film was as part of MoMA's <a class="mainlink" href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/film/3855">Future Imperfect: The Uncanny in Science Fiction</a> series presented in the summer of 2017, where it was screened with subtitles. MoMA speculates that this was an unofficial North American theatrical release of the film.

I have managed to procure this film and published a full translation with subtitles. I suspect that these are the first publicly available English subtitles for the film.

This work was not done alone: my own Mandarin is limited to “Ni Hao.” I would like to extend my personal thanks to <a class="mainlink" href="https://padma.neocities.org">紅蓮</a> (Iris) for a speedy and thorough translation, and to my homegirl <a class="mainlink" href="https://zhanpeifang.com">ZP</a> for connecting us.

Tracking down the film proved surprisingly difficult—all of the private trackers I'm on did not host it, and I am not really sure where the present recording of the film was produced (it seems to have been recorded by hand, and I would not be surprised if it was captured via recording a projected screen). The film does not seem to have been made available on any Chinese platform such as iQIYI or Youku either. Eventually, like all hidden things on the internet, I was able to follow a (now defunct) link to a VK upload.

A full live translation was made by 紅蓮 through simply watching and transcribing the English translation directly into an SRT reader. Once this was done, I was able to watch the film and fix the various timing and presentation issues into a new SRT file through [Subtitle Edit Online](https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit/). Of all the various SRT editors I have tried, this one seems to be the best (despite not supporting keyboard shortcuts).

In case you choose to republish the film with subtitles, here is how I would prefer to be credited:
