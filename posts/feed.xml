		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I have become very enamored by the idea of becoming a federal agent. This is due to numerous reasons, the most prominent among them the fact that I’ve been reading a couple of books: &lt;em&gt;See No Evil&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Robert Baer, a CIA case operative’s memoir on being onsite during the War on Terror from the ‘70s to the ‘90s, and &lt;em&gt;Legacy of Ashes&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Tim Weiner, which is a Pulitzer Prize-winning history of the CIA from a guy who really, really does not like the CIA. Taken together, these books paint a pretty elegant picture: the CIA is simultaneously an agency which is more-or-less fumbling through the world and is quite bad at accomplishing its goals, while simultaneously supporting the lifestyle of several operatives who thrive essentially on the sole basis of kicking ass. Compared to academia, these guys sound like they are having the time of their life: not only am I bad at accomplishing my not-close-to-world-changing goals, I am also having very little fun in the process of accomplishing them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Leave!” you say. “If you don’t like it, find something you do like!”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;fed&amp;#x2F;cia.jpeg&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The CIA, supposedly.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah and what do I like, pray? This is about as good as it gets, I think. Not only does human life not work like that, it’s basically impossible to be a professional ‘guy who kicks the can around in the playground.’ Really the closest I’m getting is house husband slash &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;-short story writer, but even for that I need to be in some kind of stable relationship. So I’ve decided that despite not holding American citizenship I will become a federal agent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;in-more-seriousness&quot;&gt;in more seriousness&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#in-more-seriousness&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: in-more-seriousness&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I often get as response to statements like the previous one is that the CIA actively wants me to reach exactly the conclusion that the above books have led me to: that they are both quite bad at doing things that are evil while still ensuring some amount of national security, and in fact it is quite fun being a CIA operative—time of your life James Bond stuff. This is well and good, but this is only a concern if the CIA is not &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; like it’s portrayed in those books. It’s fine if I’m thinking what they want me to think as long as it also happens to be the actual truth. So the problem with this stuff about CIA psyops is that it is by and large difficult to tell whether a claimed CIA psyop is actually a psyop or whether it’s just something that is both true and also happens to be what the CIA wants me to believe. This is kind of the key thing about institutional propaganda: if it’s good then it’s really hard even for someone supposedly educated and looking out for propaganda to correctly detect it. I, for instance, am someone who is very susceptible to propaganda in the sense that I’ll very easily believe what they want me to believe (in that I actually do believe that being a CIA operative is the most fun anyone can ever have) but I’m also &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; useless since I believe pretty much every narrative that anyone tries to sell me and therefore also believe in competing ones. In fact, I think I am pretty much the ideal recipient of sophistry; I will latch on to whoever sells me the most compelling narrative, and the CIA’s narrative is really, really good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also combined with my instinct of being a natural contrarian, which means that it’s actually only in 2026 now that it’s cool to hate on three-letter agencies that I’ve come around to liking the CIA. In fact until recently since it was cool to say the type of things that Michael Moore goes around saying so I was actively in the ‘Bush is the antichrist’ camp. Really I say whatever the cool kids are saying, and in 2026 the CIA is &lt;em&gt;in&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—which, as I said, makes me a very fickle friend, since I will, sure, believe in your narrative, but that doesn’t translate to any sort of action—if I believe in everything I also largely believe in nothing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That aside, here’s my point: yes, the CIA is trying to get me to believe some or the other narrative, but they are at the very least trying to get me to believe in something.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other motivation for this whole post is a long conversation I had with a friend about &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;profserious.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;a-call-to-arms&quot;&gt;this thing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; he found online, which is a post by some guy who calls himself ‘Prof. Serious’ (but is actually Sir Anthony Finkelstein, Chief Scientific Advisor of National Security to the British Government!) in which he makes the astonishing claim that as a scientist the most important thing you can do is contribute to national defense initiatives, because Russia is evil and going to take over and we need to stop them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;fed&amp;#x2F;xfiles.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Average CIA Agent?&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an intelligent guy. I can see through his take in an instant. But that has little to do with whether the take is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: as I said, compelling narratives are significantly better than &lt;em&gt;true&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; ones, and it’s fun to see the sophistication with which he actually argues his point—for one, the article is quite boring and proceeds somewhat logically without much in the way of hyperbole, which is absolutely &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for the intended audience of scientists, who think they are far too cool to buy into regular &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;-level tabloid fearmongering. Instead they will be quite seamlessly convinced by what seems to be a series of well-placed logical arguments rooted in simple and elegant theory. I mean, just look at how delicious this is:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democracy, the rule of law, the ability to freely exercise political rights, sovereignty, a rules-based international order, and the opportunity to live in peace and with security are precious and hard-won assets. They are not to be taken for granted. There are those, both state and non-state actors, who disdain them and who seek to deprive us of them, either for reasons that are ideological or rooted in greed, grievance, and hatred. They must not be permitted to do so.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defence is our means of protection. At some point we may be required to fight, and at all times we seek to deter. Our friends and allies also require support and protection. For this purpose, we require the sharpest tools and the capacity to use force. This necessarily includes defence technologies and advanced weaponry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you seeing this? This guy is a genius (and partly because I’m sure some amount of AI went into this whole thing—another thing scientists are very good at is being convinced by AI-esque takes, because they spend all their time moping around on ChatGPT). That first sentence is monumental; all the big words, I mean, &lt;em&gt;democracy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;the rule of law&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, etc, all hard-won assets—can anyone ever argue with that&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;? Followed by a bunch of non-sequiturs that seem to proceed logically but can easily be debunked as complete tosh, and yet remain completely undetectable as fallacious to anyone who considers themselves a detector of fallacies. It’s not a coincidence that everyone in his comments section seems to be agreeing with him as well, while pretending to mildly disagree:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We indeed need to respect our colleagues who do not want to work on &#x27;Defense&#x27; and we also need to respect that DoD&#x2F;MoD may not want to work with of our colleagues (for instance, due to their nationality).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, uh-huh, we need to be respectful and kind while destroying their countries!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;fed&amp;#x2F;opec.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Credit where credit’s due: this is Luc Delahaye’s work, which I saw at the Jeu de paume.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I’m disagreeing with him, but I’m really only pointing out how nice and well-constructed the whole thing is. In fact I find his narrative quite compelling precisely because it’s presented to me in the above manner, while the alternative is a slog through tedious and boring facts. Like, I know what Prof. Serious is trying to accomplish, because he outright just comes and says it. He’s not fooling around, he wants you to do research for the military. He’s not trying to pass it off as anything less than what it actually is, similar the CIA’s wink-wink strategy: yeah we are evil but we’re also having a fun time and actually love to show off how important we are to the country. These are very nice narratives, very beautiful dreams. So of course I would buy them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-scientists&quot;&gt;the scientists&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-scientists&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-scientists&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, what’s the best our side has got? My friend wrote a long response tediously complaining about the fallacies that our colleague in National Security was committing, which is only ever a good response to &lt;em&gt;rationalists&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, who are decidedly not the target audience for Prof. Serious’s screed; rationalists are happy to work for defense because they are pretty much amoral about anything except making money and&#x2F;or gaining power. The target audience of Prof. Serious’s stuff are scientists, like regular scientists who think that they are doing great things and changing the world and are very susceptible to believing that whatever technology the people giving them grants want to fund is somehow &lt;em&gt;good&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for the world. Many of them will openly come out and say that they don’t agree with the people giving them grants and know that they are evil, or whatever, but they still persist in the task. Then what is the psychology going on here?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that it’s pretty much the same psychology going on when I claim that I can be a Fed: yes, I understand on a logical level that this is bad, but my existential conception—the thing that I feel ‘in my bones’—is largely pessimism, and so I can think that it’s morally bad without getting the gut feeling that this is wrong, which means that I will have few qualms about &lt;em&gt;joining&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a Federal Agency (whether I will be able to survive is another matter).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about guilt is that it generally causes you &lt;em&gt;pain&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Whatever the cause is—Christian indoctrination, genuine biological response, etc—is largely irrelevant. The question of whether you can ‘live with it’ comes down to how strong your physiological response is. I often feel gross about certain things, like smoking, hence why I don’t do it. Somehow it feels kind of wrong (and so you do get a little bit of a kick out of it if you indulge). Either these scientists don’t feel it, or they’re actively shoving it down because it, for example, feeds their children. The latter is something that is very difficult to argue with: I would definitely judge someone who chooses an arbitrary notion of ethics over their own children. But the former is something I think is not talked about very much. It doesn’t seem to me that nurses and doctors are going around doing evil things—no one ever accuses them of working unethically. What drives a certain kind of person to become a doctor over becoming a scientist? The answer, I suspect, is bleak: scientists are far more drawn to the allure of ‘scientific advancement’—ie, shaping the world in their image—than doctors, who are people that dedicate their lives to saving and helping other people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that regard, perhaps the big lie is that science is somehow an act that is good for the world, or that scientists are heroes. There are all these principles like ‘following the scientific method’ which somehow leads to something like 70% of studies being pretty much useless, wrong, unfalsifiable and unreproducible all at once, or ‘be aware of the ethical implications of your research’ as if Albert Hoffman somehow knew that LSD was going to be the great psychoactive substance of the century—this guy was trying to make medicines. Neither can you expect individual people to somehow anticipate the world-changing implications of of their actions, nor can you expect them to care. In fact, I think I’m willing to posit that scientists are temperamentally more psychopathic than the rest of the population, in that they are able to list out the variety of ethical frameworks they support to justify their research without internalizing any of them. I don’t think scientists believe in anything except for the fact that they are scientists, and therefore &lt;em&gt;x&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is what they should do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it is in fact very easy to see why scientists would buy into Prof. Serious’s argument completely: they already want to believe in it because they want some hierarchical big-shot (if there’s anything scientists love more than pretending they are smart it’s lapping up whatever a person with a Wikipedia page says) to tell them what to do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;fed&amp;#x2F;70s.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Nothing better.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess my big problem with all this is the underlying assumption that intelligence is somehow a virtue. I seem to be smart, but indulging in my intelligence is one of my biggest vices; the time I feel best is almost certainly when I’m kissing a girl or watching the new &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; movie or literally just lying around pedantically discussing my friends’ workplace drama over some chips and guac. Scientists love to pretend that they are intelligent, but what good is this intelligence if it translates to a world which is generally proving to be objectively poorer?&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; Which is why I don’t like all this business about ‘how to be more productive!’ or ‘this is what the great scientists do!’ or ‘this is why you should work for Northrop Grumman!’ and so on and so forth. It starts with this assumption that you should be more productive or that you should be a great scientist. What’s wrong with being a bad scientist? We seem to have enough good ones, perhaps we require a few bad ones? Wouldn’t that be nice? Wouldn’t it be fun to have a bunch of unproductive scientists who mostly do nothing?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the CIA isn’t offering these little tidbits, it’s literally shipping you off to Iran and giving you a mission to do that involves kicking ass, and all of a sudden this scientific work seems so quaint.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what I mean about narratives? All that’s going on is that Prof. Serious is trying to feed you a little bit of that CIA lifestyle, making your work &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; something, because right now it means nothing. He’s outsourcing ethical responsibility. You don’t have to pretend anymore—just join the dark side, we need you anyway, and you actually get to feel better about yourself than you ever did before because he is, on a fundamental level, right—working for defense is absolutely going to give your work more meaning than anything else will, because it is accomplishing a shared goal of people who want to accomplish tangible goals. Edward Teller absolutely believed in defense, and guess what? He got to build the hydrogen bomb. How many people can say that?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These institutions—the Feds, Defense Agencies, etc—these aren’t evil corporations, they’re meaning-making institutions. The people in them believe in things. Yes the CIA is evil, but what’s the alternative? That everyone know that the CIA is evil, including CIA agents, and they do their task anyway? It doesn’t work like that. People do tasks because they believe in those tasks. So when Prof. Serious says that you should work for defense, he’s just allowing people to openly believe what they already secretly do: that it’s okay to work for a defense agency because you think it’s cool and you believe in what they’re selling. It’s why he can write whatever he wants and responses to the article will never work—not because he’s convincing anyone of anything they don’t already believe, but that he’s allowing those who believe to join them. He’s going to get a slew of rebuttals from people who aren’t buying his argument for a second, like my friend, but that’s not what he cares about. The moment that even one person who reads his article starts openly agreeing with him, he’s won, no matter how hard a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; op-ed comes down on him.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the power of a narrative?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s our narrative? I told my friend to slander the guy and expose him for a psyop, but he said that he doesn’t want to attack the author, he wants to address the underlying argument. This is why ‘our side’ is losing, because we have nothing to offer. He’s offering the people democracy and the ability to fight for it—what argument are we giving, that you have democracy anyway and that you don’t need to fight for it? What’s the action item here? What are we collectively believing in? What are our meaning-making institutions, if we are to fight for the Feds? The cypherpunks, the guys who call themselves &lt;em&gt;Anonymous&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—these people organize well, because they believe in the First Amendment. They believe in the founding fathers. But in this postmodern world where all the conspiracies are true, what’s the point of being anti-establishment? There used to be an Other—what else is there now?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;fed&amp;#x2F;wargames.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;What I thought cryptography would be like.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of people out there who need someone smarter and more capable to tell them what to believe in. What do you think happens when the only people willing to do that are the Feds?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a bleak world, and we live in bleak times. There’s got to be some narrative out there to latch on, and until we find it, we’re going to be locked in this ceaseless limbo where the bad guys get trillions of dollars of funding for building data centers that eat trees for breakfast while the rest of us write articles in Ethics journals while aging German women clap us on the back. Academia is toast.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean these are the things I personally am always arguing against—one of the great failures of socialism is that somehow people who have a socialist personality type are also decidedly not the kind of people who hate seatbelts with a passion. In other words, I’m definitely not big on the rule of law myself, pirate that I am. I wonder why socialism only attracts academic busybodies! Why would I ever be a socialist if they won’t let me scream &lt;em&gt;Tell your boyfriend if he says he&#x27;s got beef &#x2F;&#x2F; That I&#x27;m a vegetarian and I ain&#x27;t fucking scared of him&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; at the top of my lungs?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing scientists love to say is the Steven Pinker stuff about the world getting better by all metrics. To that my answer: look around you. I think people had more spirit in them during literally World War II. The leading cause of zoomer death in this world is irony poisoning, that’s how ‘good’ the world is getting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the more conventional blogging. I haven’t been writing anything here for a while primarily due to three reasons:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;thepaleking&amp;#x2F;paris.jpeg&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had a brief relationship that sent me into a downward spiral&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;, and&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve been writing a lot of fiction, instead, and I recently bought the domain &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;paleking&#x2F;brucespringsteencoverband.com&quot;&gt;brucespringsteencoverband.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on which you will soon be able to read all my short (and long) fiction free of charge, except if you want to donate some pocket change. In fact I will soon migrate this blog as well to said website and attempt to scrub my identity off it—it’s not that there’s any kind of stigma about this, most of the stuff I write on this blog is by and large incomprehensible and therefore inoffensive, but I still don’t want to risk it with all these AI crawlers; presumably at some point Grokula or whatever the big new thing is will scrape through the entire archive of my posts and come up with some damning verdict like ‘this guy is too neurotic and spends all his time kvetching,’ at which point the only appropriate response for me will be to shamefully retire from blogging and instead become a coal miner&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got into a barfight with a United States Marine&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have been doing instead is recovering from a very, very bad winter, the worst on record (mentally and physically) while trying to rid myself of both the aforementioned relationship and also 10 days of mental persecution I lived through when my rationalist friend decided to spend Christmas with me. Why did I do that? I don’t know.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was mostly a losing battle, until I decided to start reading some books. One of them was &lt;em&gt;The Faces&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Tove Ditlevsen—meh, overall, and she’s a bit too obscurant in the essentials. The other was a copy of DFW’s &lt;em&gt;Oblivion&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; I bought when I went to Amsterdam&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4&quot;&gt;4&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;. I haven’t finished &lt;em&gt;Oblivion&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; because I still haven’t read &lt;em&gt;The Soul is Not a Smithy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Suffering Channel&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but I’ve been purposefully delaying them because &lt;em&gt;Good Old Neon&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; did such a number on me that it really left me all screwed-up. As you can see, I write like a person who has many of the same fundamental ailments as DFW, which I think is ADHD + some or the other Cluster B personality disorder, and so reading something like &lt;em&gt;Good Old Neon&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which is about a guy who is a compulsively manipulative performer convinced that he’s fraudulent, is like getting slapped in the face&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#5&quot;&gt;5&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;. I actually don’t think I’m fraudulent so much so as have a tendency to behave like a &lt;em&gt;wastoid&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which I’ll get to in a minute. But in any case, this left me in circles of neuroticism that I had to piecemeal my way out of.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to give you a more accurate account of my holidays but unfortunately I can’t without wanting to spend copious amounts of time on things like how the other day I saw her in the elevator and had a whole dipping-the-madeleine moment because we’d made out in it before but also noticed that her hair color was lighter and this sent me into a shocking spiral of mixed tenderness—like I got knocked out full bugs bunny style—so I’ll just try to summarize it. Basically: existential crisis combined with crippling migraines.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’m building to via this whole thing is that I had a couple of transformative, miraculous experiences. First things first I went to the Notre Dame immediately after watching &lt;em&gt;My Night at Maud’s&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; around the New Year and this transformed in me in some fundamental sense. &lt;em&gt;My Night at Maud’s&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a movie about a guy who does math and has girl problems. So that’s already me. His particular type of girl problems are also absurdly specific, which is that he is (a) attracted almost exclusively to women who are bad for him, and (b) claims to be catholic and moral&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#6&quot;&gt;6&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; but he confuses being a romantic at heart with being moral, which is also me. The only thing I can safely say I am is profoundly monogamous, and I don’t know if that’s any kind of moral standard I’m hitting. In any case, this movie did a number on me because this for sure would happen to me. In fact many of my relationships proceed in this exact manner—Maud has some amount of interest in me but I screw it via some mechanism that I can’t describe correctly. The next day I went to the Notre Dame with my new digicam (thanks Jake!) from 2004 and had a transformative experience. I became a man in touch with God. Not so much in touch with God in that my belief in God is really dependent on my mood still, but certainly I began to see a moral dimension to my woes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in this sort of mildly flayed state that I read Wallace’s &lt;em&gt;Something to Do With Paying Attention&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which knocked me out of the park. This was the closest I’ve ever gotten to a religious experience. The setup of this is that there’s this guy called Chris Fogle who’s describing how he joined the IRS after spending all of the ‘70s being what he terms as a ‘wastoid’ and which is way too accurate to all the slacking I myself do, which mostly involves sitting around and complaining about how postmodernism has destroyed all our meaning-making institutions and getting into poorly-thought-out relationships with the belief that the right girl will fix me&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#7&quot;&gt;7&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;. I mean just read the beginning:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure I even know what to say. To be honest, a good bit of it I don’t remember. I
don’t think my memory works in quite the way it used to. It may be that this kind of work
changes you. Even just rote exams. It might actually change your brain. For the most part, it’s
now almost as if I’m trapped in the present. If I drank, for instance, some Tang, it wouldn’t
remind me of anything—I’d just taste the Tang.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, I’m supposed to explain how I arrived at this career. Where I
came from, so to speak, and what the Service means to me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the truth is that I was the worst kind of nihilist—the kind who isn’t even aware
he’s a nihilist. I was like a piece of paper on the street in the wind, thinking, ‘Now I think I’ll blow this way, now I think I’ll blow that way.’ My essential response to everything was ‘Whatever.’&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like this is already some of the greatest stuff I’ve read in my life. This is astonishing. Incredible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novella proceeds in this in-and-out manner, and the interesting thing is that there’s nothing really ‘wacky’ about Chris’s life apart from a couple of minor incidents—he mostly just screws around like anyone in the ‘70s until his dad dies somewhat disappointed in him and that causes a crisis of faith. He then watches &lt;em&gt;As the World Turns&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and has an epiphany—the CBS announcer says ‘You’re watching &lt;em&gt;As the World Turns&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;!’ and he realizes that he is, literally, watching &lt;em&gt;as the world turns&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—watching, as in, just sitting around doing nothing. Finally he ends up accidentally sitting into the wrong Advanced Tax class (he was supposed to be taking Intro to Accounting) and on the final day of classes the substitute professor gives a speech that basically single-handedly convinces him to get a haircut, stop being the wastoid he was and join the IRS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the speech.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you leave here to resume that crude approximation of a human life you have heretofore called a life, I will undertake to inform you of certain truths. I will then offer an opinion as to how you might most profitably view and respond to those truths.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will return to your homes and families for the holiday vacation and, in that festive interval before the last push of CPA examination study—trust me—you will hesitate, you will feel dread and doubt. This will be natural. You will, for what seems the first time, feel dread at your hometown chums’ sallies about accountancy as the career before you, you will read the approval in your parents’ smiles as an approval of your surrender—oh, I have been there, gentlemen; I know every cobble in the road you are walking. For the hour approaches. To begin, in that literally dreadful interval of looking down before the leap outward, to hear dolorous forecasts as to the sheer drudgery of the profession you are choosing, the lack of excitement or chance to shine on the athletic fields or ballroom floors of life heretofore.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To experience commitment as the loss of options, a type of death, the death of childhood’s limitless possibility, of the flattery of choice without duress—this will happen, mark me. Childhood’s end. The first of many deaths. Hesitation is natural. Doubt is natural. You might wish to recall, then, in three weeks’ time, should you be so disposed, this room, this moment, and the information I shall now relay to you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish to inform you that the accounting profession to which you aspire is, in fact, heroic. Please note that I have said “inform” and not “opine” or “allege” or “posit.” The truth is that what you soon go home to your carols and toddies and books and CPA examination preparation guides to stand on the cusp of is—heroism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exacting? Prosaic? Banausic to the point of drudgery? Sometimes. Often tedious? Perhaps. But brave? Worthy? Fitting, sweet? Romantic? Chivalric? Heroic?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentlemen—by which I mean, of course, latter adolescents who aspire to manhood—gentlemen, here is a truth: Enduring tedium over real time in a confined space is what real courage is. Such endurance is, as it happens, the distillate of what is, today, in this world neither I nor you have made, heroism. Heroism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By which I mean true heroism, not heroism as you might know it from films or the tales of childhood. You are now nearly at childhood’s end; you are ready for the truth’s weight, to bear it. The truth is that the heroism of your childhood entertainments was not true valor. It was theater. The grand gesture, the moment of choice, the mortal danger, the external foe, the climactic battle whose outcome resolves all—all designed to appear heroic, to excite and gratify an audience. An audience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentlemen, welcome to the world of reality—there is no audience. No one to applaud, to admire. No one to see you. Do you understand? Here is the truth—actual heroism receives no ovation, entertains no one. No one queues up to see it. No one is interested.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True heroism is you, alone, in a designated work space. True heroism is minutes, hours, weeks, year upon year of the quiet, precise, judicious exercise of probity and care—with no one there to see or cheer. This is the world. Just you and the job, at your desk. You and the return, you and the cash-flow data, you and the inventory protocol, you and the depreciation schedules, you and the numbers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True heroism is a priori incompatible with audience or applause or even the bare notice of the common run of man. In fact, the less conventionally heroic or exciting or adverting or even interesting or engaging a labor appears to be, the greater its potential as an arena for actual heroism, and therefore as a denomination of joy unequaled by any you men can yet imagine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To retain care and scrupulosity about each detail from within the teeming womball of data and rule and exception and contingency which constitutes real-world accounting—this is heroism. To attend fully to the interests of the client and to balance those interests against the high ethical standards of FASB and extant law—yea, to serve those who care not for service but only for results—this is heroism. This may be the first time you’ve heard the truth put plainly, starkly. Effacement. Sacrifice. Service. To give oneself to the care of others’ money—this is effacement, perdurance, sacrifice, honor, doughiness, valor. Hear this or not, as you will. Learn it now, or later—the world has time. Routine, repetition, tedium, monotony, ephemeracy, inconsequence, abstraction, disorder, boredom, angst, ennui—these are the true hero’s enemies, and make no mistake, they are fearsome indeed. For they are real.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much, you say? Cowboy, paladin, hero? Gentlemen, read your history. Yesterday’s hero pushed back at bounds and frontiers—he penetrated, tamed, hewed, shaped, made, brought things into being. Yesterday’s society’s heroes generated facts. For this is what society is—an agglomeration of facts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is now today’s era, the modern era. In today’s world, boundaries are fixed, and most significant facts have been generated. Gentlemen, the heroic frontier now lies in the ordering and deployment of those facts. Classification, organization, presentation. To put it another way, the pie has been made—the contest is now in the slicing. Gentlemen, you aspire to hold the knife. Wield it. To admeasure. To shape each given slice, the knife’s angle and depth of cut.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A baker wears a hat, but it is not our hat. Gentlemen, prepare to wear the hat. You have wondered, perhaps, why all real accountants wear hats? They are today’s cowboys. As will you be. Riding the American range. Riding herd on the unending torrent of financial data. The eddies, cataracts, arranged variations, fractious minutiae. You order the data, shepherd it, direct its flow, lead it where it’s needed, in the codified form in which it’s apposite. You deal in facts, gentlemen, for which there has been a market since man first crept from the primeval slurry. It is you—tell them that. Who ride, man the walls, define the pie, serve.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentlemen, you are called to account.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This changed me. It really did. I can’t describe how I felt after reading this, and I don’t need to, because it’s exactly as Chris Fogle did—like something had happened, like someone was talking to me, like directly to me, and that things were suddenly different. It became clear to me how much of a wastoid I myself was, going around and getting into all these crappy relationships for God knows what reason, playing at being some kind of enlightened nihilist while I was actually just using that nihilism to escape the fundamental duties of living a life. All of a sudden I felt sick.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did what I could. The next day, I made a poster of the speech and put it on the wall. You can download it if you want yourself &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&#x2F;assets&#x2F;blog&#x2F;thepaleking&#x2F;quote.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I’ve decided to make it available for everyone as a PDF.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not joining the IRS, but something has been restored to my life. Routine. Repetition. Things make sense to me. Objects are concrete. Morality exists. Things are good and bad. I have an internal compass, and it’s finally pointed toward something.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to say something about this realization because I’ve never conceived of myself as a ‘real’ slacker, just someone playing at one: I’m a very young PhD student in a difficult mathematical field; by all means I’m very successful. But if you’re in a bad place mentally like I very often am then all these things pile up and make it hard for you to get anything done. You feel all over the place, nothing makes sense. I’ve always suspected that drudgery puts you in the correct spot—like too much free time is bad for a person, it gives them all these ideas. Let me try to actually work myself, for a change; write more papers, do more math. Things in general feel very abstract. I have a bad tendency that when I’m in a relationship I feel grounded, but PhD life is quite lonely especially if you’re extremely young like I am—it’s hard to make this transition from having friends that you hang out with all day long to having people you meet like once or twice a week for an hour or two. This is also combined with the fact that due to various circumstances I have astonishing amounts of free time (I can produce a lot of work in hyperfocused periods which frees up my days). Having a girlfriend fixes that because every day I get home and meet her and it’s so nice, I get to spend time with someone I love. Things feel real when I have someone to share them with, tell her what happened at work, and then she tells me what happened at work with her, and then we cook dinner together. Somehow the lack of that fundamental structure just makes things feel ephemeral. Maybe I’m just too much of a talker or something, every time something happens no matter how minor I want to text and share it with her. It’s a lonely feeling not being able to do that, and I guess that’s why I’m always getting into these things thoughtlessly. I do know a lot of people with whom I can share things, but there’s something to be said about immediacy—just texting her and telling her ‘you won’t believe what happened’ is a big deal for me the moment it happens. Sigh. Sometimes things just suck, especially when you’re new to a city and your best friends are time zones apart.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’m back to serious work, all the slacking is over.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was actually really bad, largely because it started out as really good. We got along perfectly and there was basically every bit of that knockout ‘chemistry’ or whatever magical term they’re using these days when two people get together and all the romantic interactions are perfectly natural and easygoing while still being remarkably intense—you know the deal, or at least I hope you do. I mean it only lasted for a little while and we never actually got ‘together’ due to a variety of complicated and not so complicated reasons that will nevertheless be a hassle to describe and therefore I won’t. There were of course some positives to this situation—I can tell you about, for instance, how I found out that shopping with the right person can be a genuinely great experience, or how when she did it somehow I no longer minded talking throughout the length of a movie’s duration, many many such things that have basically left me locked in my room with migraines for days on end—but the fact that there &lt;em&gt;were&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; some positives means that the ending of the intense fling hit like a freight train&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#sub&quot;&gt;8&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about coal miners a lot recently. I think the appropriate guilt has finally caught up: I now feel like I am somehow letting my ancestors down by being a researcher in a first-world country instead of being the coal miner I was born to be. I used to read these Percy Jackson books as a kid in which ADHD was revealed to be a sign that you’re a demigod and therefore suited to hyperfocusing on combat and physical activity. It is true: when I hit the gym I hit the gym &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. If only things were so simple and so nice, but at this point it’s pretty much confirmed that while I have mathematician&#x2F;artist personality I absolutely have coal miner fundamentals. My grandparents were literal farmers. I should be Clark Kent, not Philip Roth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one’s more of a joke, but it did happen. Context: I went to a bar in my Michigan jersey and these guys were from Ohio so they were already pissed. I was somewhat late to a pub quiz and joined this team which weren’t doing all so well and answered a bunch of music questions: you won’t believe this but the songs to recognize were &lt;em&gt;I Took a Pill in Ibiza&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Mike Posner, &lt;em&gt;Island in the Sun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Weezer, &lt;em&gt;Kokomo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by the Beach Boys and &lt;em&gt;Dancing in the Dark&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by my boy Bruce. I don’t know how these guys can call themselves Marines and not recognize the last one. But in any case they came up to me and started saying things like ‘you gotta be careful ‘round these parts’ which is hilarious to say in a pub literally within 5 minutes’ walking distance of the Notre Dame, but like I’m also not starting a fight with actual &lt;em&gt;Marines&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, even if they’re my height and age and everything. These guys are literal killers and very, very drunk. They screwed off after a bit of bickering, fortunately.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;4&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manic episode. Don’t ask.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;5&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;though not with a penis! My PhD advisor and I were having a discussion about our favorite words and he said that he really likes the French &lt;em&gt;bifler&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which means to get slapped in the face with a penis. My own interests are less lewd; I like ‘valley’ a lot, and also &lt;em&gt;ressentiment&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Also &lt;em&gt;schadenfreude&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, though that’s a kitschy one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;6&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like someone you know? Half my identity is being from St. Louis. The other day I actually said to someone “I’m from St. Louis, you know, we believe in things down there. Holding hands and throwing rocks into the river means something to me.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;7&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this turned out to be correct. When I was going out with the girl I’ve been complaining about in this whole post it somehow fixed me, like actually fixed me: suddenly my life was full of purpose again because the thought of doing things &lt;em&gt;for her&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; somehow changed me and got rid of all my nihilism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;sub&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;8&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes of course my coping mechanism of choice is lethal amounts of Bruce Springsteen. ‘At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet and a freight train running through the middle of my head’—this is me every day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night I went to watch the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uefa.com&#x2F;womenschampionsleague&#x2F;match&#x2F;2046637--paris-fc-vs-barcelona&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Paris FC vs FC Barcelona Women’s UEFA Champions League&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; game as part of a special popularity raising event organized by several universities around Paris, who were offering free tickets to students in an attempt to beat the all-time Women’s UCL Paris FC attendance record—and they did! The 20,000 capacity stadium ended up filling about 15,200 of its seats. This was the first time I’ve been to a sports game in quite a while—I used to go to Beavers games when I was at Oregon State with some amount of frequency, but this tapered off significantly towards the end largely because they were really too pricey to justify; a game against Utah would be $5 for like the student ticket, which is great, but even against UCLA or something it would go as high as $45, and that really does seem like a formidable sum when you’re on a meager student salary. Like I could get a new shirt with that money, you know.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;parisvbarca&amp;#x2F;ucl.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to sports games was a fairly sparse thing in my childhood—we were in that middle zone where we weren’t invested enough for this to be a necessary purchase but we also weren’t rich enough for it to be a luxury worth affording. What ended up happening was that I can basically count the games I went to in person in my hand; a few Cardinals games and one Blues game all the way back when I lived in St. Louis, and since then just a single Indian Super League game a few years ago in 2018 or 2019, I think. I was always pretty substandard as a soccer player but my brother turned out to be quite good, and we would go to watch him play as part of his club with some amount of frequency, but these were junior, U-14 and U-16 games. Which is funny, because sports was a pretty big part of my childhood, as a whole; I wasn’t that big of a player (really just into neighborhood soccer, some amount of long-distance running and swimming) but certainly into consuming sports as entertainment&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lack of going to games makes the memory of the few times I did go to one quite magical in my head, crossed as it is with the perspective of a child. This particular game was less so. We were seated on the stand right behind the goalpost—I’m not sure what to call it in the context of soccer, I’d say ‘end zone’ otherwise—next to a bunch of French teenagers who found it very entertaining that I was speaking English and wearing my University of Michigan hoodie&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;. Eventually they started chatting me up and calling me their ‘bro’ or whatever, which was very funny. But all this is ultimately fine. The game itself was actually really good, Barcelona winning 2-0 and PFC screwing up too many goddamn chances through poor finishing, but there was also suspense throughout—like it never really slowed down into a tactical mess, the Barcelona team maintained the press well enough to create several strong chances even if they only ended up converting two of them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately this was one of those experiences which is quite routine as an adult but very much an event as a kid, kind of like going to the mall or the dentist, which makes me feel somewhat strange about the whole thing. Did I enjoy it? Sure, but it wasn’t a late-summer evening game with hot dogs and a full crowd, but that’s secondary to my immediate observation that stadium floodlights kind of suck now. Because I haven’t been to a game in literal years all my memories of stadium floodlights are what are apparently called ‘halogen lamps’ as opposed to LEDs, whereas they’re all LEDs now. The key difference is that halogen lamps create light via heat (so they become really hot very quickly and consume more power) while LEDs use something called electroluminescence, which means that they light up when electricity is passed through them, and hence consume significantly less power while also not making any heat. This means that LEDs are a lot better when it comes to most purposes apart from setting a nice ambience and with respect to the actual visibility of the stadium, which seem to me to be the most crucial components for having a good time at the game. So why is it that LEDs have basically replaced halogen in all stadium floodlights, now?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like the answer is a mixture of cost and efficiency, which is okay, but also because of several other reasons:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light peaks differently and hence is angled differently, which means that LEDs provide better illumination to the players (and so they can see the ball better). This also ensures significantly less light pollution outside the stadium.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4K and 8K video broadcasting apparently need more consistent lighting with higher peaks, and hence it makes sense to use LEDs in that context.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the downside is that it makes the stadium look like this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know, I just don’t like this neon green look that’s going on. It’s too bright and doesn’t feel like a game. Furthermore, it doesn’t even look like there’s any kind of acceptable compromise here, because these two things are inherently at odds—you can’t really design any better intermediate which performs both because you either choose to optimize for broadcasting and the player view or for the live spectator view, and we all know who wins out in that regard. Maybe Stade Jean-Bouin just has too many lights, or something, or they haven’t calibrated the colors correctly, but I have a strong view of Stade Sébastien Charléty from my balcony and even that looks like it has similar problems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is just one of those things that we’ve lost to history permanently, and I’m living with freak nostalgia because I’m not a person who regularly goes to these games—perhaps my annoyance is not particularly different from my annoyance about the fact that I’m, like, a lot bigger in size, now, and so stadiums look smaller and significantly more comprehensible. Because I associate stadiums with grandiosity and life-and-death matters, almost liminal in scope, not functional places where people actually go. The act of thinking about them as logistical operations and maximizing their efficiency always feels like sacrilege.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess you can’t really shake off your heritage, no matter how hard you try—to me falling in love feels like ball games in the summer, hot dogs, abandoned parking lots, autumn leaves, cigarette smoke, driving into the sunset. And a big part of that is halogen lamps, and that makes me kind of sad.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big one was soccer: I had inherited Man Utd from my cousins ever since I was three or four and they were actually good under Sir Alex&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;, while my brother was solidly a Borussia Dortmund guy, both of which provided enough entertainment to thoroughly captivate a couple of otherwise bookish tweens. Apart from that, badminton and cricket were common, usually in the context of the Indian players. Later I got into football with my college friends (go birds!) and eventually basketball and baseball, too, and Chess and Formula 1, if you consider those sports. Tennis was always quite opaque; it lasted too long, though I don’t mind passively consuming it in the background. The ones I really never got were boxing, UFC, that sort of thing. Bit too violent, I guess.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never attended UMich or even been to Ann Arbor, so yeah I’m one of those people who wear branded university clothes without actually ever attending that university, but I do have a little bit of a claim to authenticity by having bought it in Greenville, MI while on a cross-country road trip to my friend &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;januzellij.github.io&quot;&gt;Jake’s&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; hometown. The reason why I was wearing it at the game was because it was the only piece of navy blue clothing I had which matched the Paris FC colors, and also because it was like forty degrees.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I need to do a deep dive as to what’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; wrong at Man Utd, although it looks like they are getting the tiniest bit better this season, against all odds, so maybe I’ll instead cover the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1973%E2%80%9374_Manchester_United_F.C._season&quot;&gt;bizarre 1973-74 season&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am always on the lookout for excuses to talk about my favorite films, and me getting older by another year is always a good reason—22, thank you very much—so I have decided to blog a nice curation of writings pertaining the films I enjoyed this year&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;. My usual film retrospective comprises of me making some kind of list that ‘updates’ my ranking of the 100 best movies of all time, or something of that sort, but at this point that ranking is no longer as malleable as it used to be and I also don’t believe in long, ordered lists of movies anymore. Last year I tried instead making a list of ‘my personal canon.’ This listed about 270 films, but such a thing is quite useless as a retrospective—I never got around to writing even a one-line discussion of what the particular film does for me, so this year I will attempt to try something primarily verbose and hence more in-line with what I even intend to accomplish with these.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;thoughts-and-prayers&quot;&gt;thoughts and prayers&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#thoughts-and-prayers&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: thoughts-and-prayers&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immediate impetus behind my curation of this list was this essay &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thepointmag.com&#x2F;criticism&#x2F;negative-criticism&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Negative Criticism&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by Sean Tatol written for The Point, in which he outlines the critical world’s increasing emphasis on positive criticism, a phenomenon I can summarize quite simply as ‘glazing’&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;. There’s a lot of theatrics in this essay, which I mostly agree with—particularly his stance against ‘subjective absolutism,’ that passing value judgements on art is inherently a ridiculous exercise because ‘art is subjective,’&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; whatever that means—but there’s also a key corner I disagree with, which is his insistence on what a critic ought to do. I suppose that I am a critic—I watch about 150 movies a year, and write about them, often passing qualitative judgements about the films—but the task he outlines is far more suited to someone who, for lack of better phrasing, does it as a job. In real life, of course, there is no reason for anyone to write about &lt;em&gt;every&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; film they watch or attempt to pass a qualitative judgement on them, but I do believe there is still merit in building up this repertoire of taste that he affirms: that is, it is still worth looking at things via a critical eye so that you are able to make some discernment between good and bad films, and so that you can better talk about exactly what it was about the film that you liked or disliked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I moved to Paris I have been encountering quite a number of people who are into cinema, but unfortunately these experiences have proven almost universally frustrating. This is partly &lt;em&gt;because&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; cinema people have this annoying strain of easily passing qualitative judgement on certain kinds of films while also deifying others for no good reason whatsoever. Obviously what I mean is that cinema people find it quite easy to say that some or the other mid-tier Hollywood blockbuster is awful while reserving judgement for what they deem to be art films. Too much damage has been done to cinema criticism via this distinction. A film is a film. If you don’t like it you don’t like it. Of course my dad is not going to like &lt;em&gt;Blue Velvet&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, or whatever qualifies as an art film these days, and of course he is going to think that this is bad. On the other hand, cinephiles will casually proclaim that &lt;em&gt;Blue Velvet&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a masterpiece while giving all kinds of ridiculous, paper-thin arguments that have very little footing, and the reason for this is &lt;em&gt;because&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; they have been approaching these art films with reverence instead of with an attempt to perform criticism, and so they have never developed the skills necessary to evaluate such films in the first place.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, they can casually deconstruct Hollywood films with all kinds of technical metrics—my own embarrassing 17-year-old self (then contrarian as well) wrote a review of &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which criticizes the poor nature of the action sequences by coming up with all kinds of arguments such as ‘shot length too small’ or ‘inconsistencies in framing’&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4&quot;&gt;4&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;—while not realizing the inherent difficulty in creating a good, successful Hollywood film.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is that my dad is right and you are wrong. When my dad says that &lt;em&gt;Blue Velvet&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is crude and disgusting and that people should not be allowed to make movies like this, he is engaging with the actual content of the film instead of the form of the film. When you say ‘notice the blocking and how well Lynch engages the camera, how he wraps his characters in the shadows’ you are talking about things that are far besides the point. You are thinking in terms of a technician, which is fine, but the way Lynch is using his camera is as a vehicle to show you something, and you are not clever if you recognize the conceit—the whole point of the conceit &lt;em&gt;is&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to show you what he in fact wants to show you. Surely it is your duty to engage with the ‘something’ and not with the vehicle? There are many films which use the same tricks that Lynch does. Just because Lynch does it better than others does not make his films inherently better. What makes his films better is what he &lt;em&gt;says&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; via these tricks, otherwise it is just empty formalism. And empty formalism is everywhere these days; there is a reason why the term ‘Oscar Bait’ was coined, which is a simple catch-all for films which use these tricks but have little actual content in them worth scrutinizing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a number of responses I receive to these considerations, and I am now going to respond to them in the form of an FAQ.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So are the technical aspects of the film unimportant?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; It depends on the film. Just because a film is well-shot doesn&#x27;t mean it’s good, and just because a film is poorly shot doesn&#x27;t mean it’s bad. But what is important is that just because something is hard to do in practice doesn’t mean it’s worth doing. You are not rewarded for effort. A director could choose a technique that is very hard to pull off effectively and it could still be the wrong choice for the film in question. So even if you have beautiful still-life photography, if the film does nothing with it that makes it inherently valueless. There are many great films which have photography that is as good and are also able to deliver extraordinary content, while there are other films which have poorer photography and yet not brought down by this fact.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is content?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; The underlying ethos, theme, whatever the filmmaker is attempting to communicate or evoke via the film. If a film wants to put you to sleep, that is the content.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A film should be judged by how well it accomplishes what it is trying to accomplish.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; No. You are wrong. There are many things that are not worth accomplishing, and if I feel that way I will believe that the film is atrocious. I think &lt;em&gt;Birth of a Nation&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is trying to accomplish morally reprehensible things. It is a film that is certainly important to film history, and I think it is an extraordinary film that deserves to be studied, but I do not think it is a good film, nor would I ever recommend it (unless you particularly want to study the central conceit of how film can make people start believing in truly hateful things).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You think a movie should be something it is not trying to be.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Yes, obviously. If I think a film is bad of course I will think that it should be something that it is not, because I don’t like what it currently is. Often I say things like ‘this would be better if it were a standard Hollywood movie,’ and I mean it, because Hollywood movies have a strong understanding of how to be entertaining, and if a film has failed on nearly all fronts it might as well be entertaining. Entertaining people is worthwhile. It’s not some kind of consolation prize.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should read what the director says about the film.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; I’ll read about this if I find some merit in the film. I am not going to defer to the filmmaker’s intentions and judge the intentions. I will judge the actual finished product that was created. A filmmaker may be a swell guy with great intentions and still produce horrible art.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All you’re saying is that this particular film didn’t work for you.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Yes, of course that is what I am saying. I do not need to undermine every point I try to make with a ‘but that’s just me, of course.’ I don’t know why me not liking a film breaks your worldview. You can choose to not take me seriously if you don’t want to—just because I don’t like &lt;em&gt;The Godfather Part II&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; doesn’t mean that it’s a bad movie, not does it mean I’m just being contrarian. It means I don’t like it, and I can also articulate why I don’t like it. You don’t need an excuse to dismiss me.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have often found that a hallmark of a good review is whether you can omit all the proper nouns in the review and the review is still applicable only to the singular film in question.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I could keep going on and on about these cinephile pretensions, but really the point I want to make is that the reason this happens is because of a lack of willingness to issue judgments on films that you like&#x2F;don’t like, which never builds the underlying muscle that actually allows you to actually understand and articulate what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; like or don’t like about a film. The natural response to this is that when starting out people often dislike movies that are at all challenging and can become philistines in the process. I disagree that this is the case, and the reason is because taste &lt;em&gt;evolves&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It is indeed true that it is possible to dislike challenging films at first, but in articulating what you dislike about them you still earn experiences that allow you to watch challenging films that are more to your taste, and once you have a more refined set of tools for criticism you can return to the films you initially disliked and analyze them through your new lens. I didn’t like &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; when I was 17. Now I think it’s a great film. This is perfectly possible, and is in fact the norm—there are many movies I used to like but don’t, anymore, and there are many that I hated at first but now like. The reason for this is the newly refined critical taste I have.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is this—at some point you will watch Tarkovsky and think he is slow and boring and sucks. You will be right, not because you have formed the ‘correct’ opinion (there is no reason for you to maximize the number of correct opinions you have, anyway), but because you are engaging with the content of the film (in this case, the manner of delivery). Eventually, you might watch Béla Tarr and think that this is equally slow and boring, but that unlike Tarr, Tarkovsky at least seemed to be doing some kind of meditative contemplation rather than stretching out five minutes’ worth of content into 2 hours. Then you might watch something like &lt;em&gt;Millennium Mambo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and because you have gotten used to ‘slow’ cinema, you might engage with it in a more potent way and actually enjoy this film very much indeed—and then when you come back to Tarkovsky you notice that the only similarity between these films is that they are slow, and that is not enough to dislike a film, and then you might notice that Tarkovsky seems to be lingering on his alien landscapes which seem to externalize the psychologies of his characters, and now that you know what to look for the film might not seem so slow at all, really, while Tarr still remains a complete mystery to you. And you might think that actually, Tarkovsky is very good, and Tarr is very bad, and this is now your own developed critical taste borne out of engagement with cinema and not merely with the form—which would lead you to believe that everything slow is good, and yet not get anything out of these films that sticks with you when you’re at home alone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, that is enough hedging, and it is time to turn to the actual retrospective.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are films that I watched for the first time this year—they are not necessarily new films that were released during this period.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-best&quot;&gt;the best&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-best&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-best&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miami Vice (2006) dir. Micheal Mann&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easily one of the greatest action&#x2F;crime films ever made—there’s an overwhelming plot that is logistically impossible to follow and a digital camera elevating the gritty cops played by Farrell and Foxx to mythological demigods in their consummate professionalism, but it’s also a film that completely understands that the logistics of the action are secondary. Mann’s thesis statement—in all that neon haze all that Mann’s camera is zooming in on is the things that broken people do for each other. All that matters is love, or the absence of it. Not a better scene than Gong Li and Colin Farrell on the speedboat—the ending with her speeding away to Mogwai while Farrell walks back to the car in the rain might literally be the most sublime thing I’ve ever seen. A movie about time, and a movie about luck, and a movie about how those are the same thing. Better to have loved and lost than never loved at all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rachel Getting Married (2008) dir. Jonathan Demme&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; great film about being an outsider in your family—there’s a lot I could say about it, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;goodkid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;but I already have&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haru (1996) dir. Yoshimitsu Morita&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of it is that it’s a time-capsule of both Japan and the internet at a very particular time, but also because it’s a movie that’s actually about the process of falling in love in the internet age—a lot of movies skip over this aspect entirely, but that really is the central conceit of &lt;em&gt;Haru&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which treats its characters with an empathic reverence that is really rare in films of this kind; they’re not perfect, nor are they trying to be. There’s so much here about the dynamics of male-female friendships that is impossible to capture; when she stops responding but he never stops talking to her, because to him she’s so intimately tied to the way that he processes his day and his life that to end their contact is akin to him snipping off a piece of himself permanently—the way they decide to meet each other for a fleeting moment, waving a handkerchief in the wind and flashing by with a glimpse at 200 miles per hour. The handheld camerawork at the end is spine-tingling… probably the best film about romantic love I’ve seen since &lt;em&gt;Before Sunrise&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper Moon (1973) dir. Peter Bogdanovich&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously a feel-good film for the ages, but also a lamentation for a certain kind of rogue who could was ethically compromised but never morally, if you know what I mean—Moses Pray, one of the great movie characters and one of the great movie dads—teaching his daughter all the wrong lessons about how to live in the world but all the right ones as to how to survive in it. Tatum O’Neal is obviously the best child actor I’ve ever seen, but the genuine love the movie has for her and the ways of life she partakes in is heartbreaking. Another Bogdanovich masterpiece, proving that there is no one out there who possesses a greater understanding of the soul of the American way of life and what was lost. We don’t get these fundamentally good guys, anymore; true American hero, Moses Pray.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blow-Out (1981) dir. Brian de Palma&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great film about American institutional fallout and the devastation that comes with it. It’s so incriminating because the reason that Travolta ‘fails’ has less to do with any mistake on his part or the fact that the institutions are occupied by bad people—it’s the institutional infrastructure itself which works against him, be it the media or the governor’s office, completely neutralizing innocents and destroying any chance he has at ‘justice,’ or whatever that means—is justice worth anything after Sally’s death, anyway? The irony of the ending is of course the ultimate justification that capitalism loves turning itself into entertainment; even bleaker today once you realize that the fact that there was ultimately no meaning afforded to the incident of the blow-out is a function today not of ignorance, but of uncaring. A gunshot straight into the American dream.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;His Motorbike, Her Island (1986) dir. Nobuhiko Obayashi&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another story about the process of people falling in love, but this one’s basically the closest thing to a modern fairy tale rather than anything concrete like &lt;em&gt;Haru&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, complete with the ambivalent but ultimately tragic ending. There’s a liveliness to how Obayashi frames this with the switching between the color and the black and white that ultimately transforms these motorbikes into living, breathing creatures, not particularly different from David Cronenberg’s &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but less clinically erotic, more genuinely sensual.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persona (1966) dir. Ingmar Bergman&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bergman’s anti-therapy masterpiece, peeling back the soul to reveal nothing but emptiness inside. Bodies burst into flames and melt into each other. Don’t empty out your soul to a void and be surprised when the void fills itself with the ugliest things about you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-worst&quot;&gt;the worst&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-worst&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-worst&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norbit (2007) dir. Eddie Murphy&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, really wanted this to be some kind of misunderstood masterpiece but nope—couldn’t even finish it, it was so aggressively unfunny and garish with Murphy partaking in some of the most offensive acting I’ve seen in my life. Nothing at all funny about it, just gross-out potty humor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dreamers (2003) dir. Bernardo Bertolucci&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transgressive for the sake of transgression, but more so just cinephile wish-fulfillment. Wouldn’t it be great if you sucked but film-obsessed Eva Green fell in love with you anyway? Very bad stuff, just &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for very annoying people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World of Tomorrow (2015) dir. Don Hertzfeldt&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely inauthentic faux-deep bullshit that purports to say something about existence but is interested only in the least interesting parts of existence. What if I fell in love with a robot and nothing interesting happened? AI-generated melodrama.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the Wonder (2012) dir. Terrence Malick&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly not that bad in terms of composition but it basically devolves into a bunch of completely trite and unearned proclamations. “I have begun to doubt in God,” says a preacher. How original—cue &lt;em&gt;First Reformed&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; that’s a premise, not an emotional climax. Although it really is very beautiful, and everything with Ben Affleck is visually perfect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Fish called Wanda (1988) dir. Charles Crichton&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggressively unfunny and very, very mean to its characters—I understand that this is basically just the Monty Python gang riffing but they used to be funny when riffing, dammit. Continues my streak of wondering how Jamie Lee Curtis ever made it as a comedy actress considering that she can’t pull off any bit at all. The favorite comedy of the most annoying person you know—I’m sorry but I just don’t find people being completely idiotic compelling or funny, and I want to punch Kevin Kline in the face.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) dir. Nicholas Stoller&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actively evil, unlike the others, purporting that you can suck and treat everyone around you like trash and Mila Kunis will inexplicably come and fix you. It’s somewhat funny when Paul Rudd is in it, but Segel’s ego is so high and so misplaced that whatever allure this has ultimately doesn’t matter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) dir. Woody Allen&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this would be good, considering it’s Allen, but I didn’t think for a second that it would be his best—the great feel-bad film of the age, chronicling cosmic injustice before it became cool. Both stories are already incredibly compelling in form and function but the ending makes you filled with the kind of underlying rage at the world that only the greatest of all time can channel successfully. It’s too spoiler-heavy to give more of my thoughts here, unfortunately.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joe Versus the Volcano (1990) dir. John Patrick Shanley&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easily the best Hanks&#x2F;Ryan romcom, partly because it’s less of a romcom and more like the single most life-affirming movie I’ve seen in ages—absolutely and unbashedly committed to sincerity and love, with the plot literally stopping for a scene in which Hanks looks up at the moon and thanks God for the wonderful gift that is life—and you know what, you believe it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Field of Dreams (1989) dir. Phil Alden Robinson&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-best Kevin Costner baseball film, and also the second-best Iowa film (goes to &lt;em&gt;Bridges of Madison County&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) but maybe the #1 dad classic, like, ever? It uses up all the sense that it could make just to engineer a final game where a man plays catch with his dead dad, proving that once what was the only thing that ever mattered. And that’s a damn good trade.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Boyfriend’s Back (1993) dir. Bob Balaban&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost unheard of but the greatest movie about the eternal recurrence ever made—character gets another chance and makes not necessarily the right choices but the choices which would ensure that he never regrets another moment of his life. Complete and total self-actualization in 90 minutes with some of the funniest dream sequences of all time placed one after the other. It’s not wish-fulfillment if you’ve gotta take the leap.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October Sky (1999) dir. Joe Johnston&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the purest expressions of American propaganda: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letterboxd.com&#x2F;idontplaytetris&#x2F;film&#x2F;october-sky&#x2F;&quot;&gt;full review here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paycheck (2003) dir. John Woo&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Woo’s best—a masterclass in the specific elevation of &lt;em&gt;pulp&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; above all else; not camp, not kitsch, but the specific melodramatic pulp element that propels science fiction from being about the science to being about the fiction. Affleck is exceptional, like always; I suppose this is one of my core contrarian instincts, but there’s almost no role in which I’ve ever found him lacking, and his bizarre cluelessness really adds to an uncouth everyman charm, especially here, where he’s almost instinctively unintelligent because he’s so smug but is convincing enough in his haphazard improvisation that you start to think of him as something like John McClane by the end. The timeskip aspect is used for genuinely intelligent ends and the aerogel atmosphere transforms it into something sublime—better than &lt;em&gt;Minority Report&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; because it has so much more fun with the premise. Not all sci-fi is dystopic—sometimes things just suck in a pretty okay world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Night of the Hunter (1955) dir. Charles Laughton&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has grown on me since I first saw it, but the nightmare fairy-tale imagery of the boat and the spiders followed by the business at the old woman’s house is still far more compelling than the sheer nightmare of the first half, which really is just slow, formalist horror that is completely unappealing to me and forms the backdrop of all the modern ‘elevated’ stuff I dislike—this isn’t just the template, it’s the entire playbook. Doesn’t mean I’m going to like it though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s Such a Beautiful Day (2012), dir. Don Hertzfeldt&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly better than the awful &lt;em&gt;World of Tomorrow&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but almost nothing about its upbeat premise that things are beautiful and things will get better registers—part of it is that the protagonist has a neurological problem (something akin to dementia) rather than any regular mental illness, and part of it is that the sincerity manifests as patronizing. The best part is the stuff with the ancestors, everything else seems to be besides the point.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metropolitan (1990) dir. Whit Stillman&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly I watched this while very high, but the dialogue seemed a lot more performative than in &lt;em&gt;The Last Days of Disco&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and I think Stillman lends himself better to older protagonists—though it must be said that &lt;em&gt;Metropolitan&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; didn’t have Kate Beckinsale and Chloë Sevigny to deliver Stillman’s mouthfuls. Comes off as a bit glib, really, and the conversational progression is too slow. That said, the last 1&#x2F;3rds of this were basically incomprehensible in my state and so I can’t really judge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Devil, Probably (1977) dir. Robert Bresson&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently he’s described as an ‘ascetic’ or something but for a film with a truly exceptional thesis statement—could you continue to exist if you were a very product of the society that you so despised—Bresson takes the least interesting approach both formally and narratively. An annoying teenager sleeps around with a bunch of girls, getting increasingly edgier until he asks someone to shoot him. Is there not a better way to deliver these themes than through dialogue and a guy walking around aimlessly? What Lynch could have done with this premise—that said, it’s not the worst, just a disappointment through and through.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Sex Life… or How I Got into an Argument (1996) dir. Arnaud Desplechin&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not at all a bad film but a predictable one, which makes things unfortunate. It’s fun watching Amalric and his group of friends live and love in Paris but it never really manages to get its foot off that trodden Pialat&#x2F;Rohmer ground into something radical, and as it stands it’s ‘merely’ a good film about a philosophy student who can’t commit. Is it really worth watching yourself on screen? I see it every day in the very life I’m living. Far more of an entry to the genre than one of its crowning jewels.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeanne Dielman, 23, Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) dir. Chantal Akerman&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve wasted too much time on this thing already—read my &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;akerman&#x2F;&quot;&gt;full review here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liz and the Blue Bird (2018) dir. Naoko Yamada&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuinely one of the strangest experiences of my life, where it put me into this trance-like state where it became astonishingly difficult to make heads or tails of what was happening, but definitely unintentionally. This is normally the kind of film that I like—but Yamada is committed to shooting it and framing it in the least nominally interesting way, with her weird shots of elongated feet over a Japanese voiceover I can’t really make heads or tails of. It seemed like it was proceeding through something other than ‘scenes,’ if that makes sense—the nature of the dutch angles made me confused enough that it seemed I was navigating some kind of puzzle box instead of a movie. Never have had such a visceral reaction to a film before. By the time it was over I couldn’t remember anything that had happened.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heretic (2024&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;) — not bad! Pretty stupid at times but doesn’t purport to take itself seriously.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Billy Elliot (2000)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — great movie, but pretty funny as to how it’s basically the most masculine punk-rock you could make a movie about a boy wanting to do ballet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peanuts Specials (1965-1967)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — similar to the Winnie-the-Pooh movies; genuine life lessons for kids and adults wrapped up in a thick blanket and a cup of coffee.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Short Film About Killing (1988)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — brutal stuff by Kieślowski, phenomenally sad.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I Hired a Contract Killer (1990)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — a worse version of &lt;em&gt;Joe Versus the Volcano&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but has that proletariat Kaurismäki sensibility.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reality Bites (1994)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — extremely strong and nostalgic first hour that doesn’t know what to do with the remains of the climax.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bewitched (1976)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — very strange pseudo-erotic Argentine drama, but also one of the great anarcho-primitivist films.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dirty Harry (1971)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — ain’t nothing dirty about what my boy Harry was doing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canoa: A Shameful Memory (1976)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — too sparse to really talk about. It’s a sufficient dramatization, but I can’t ever imagine thinking of it independently.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;House (1977)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — worst viewing experience of my life and the film is completely inseparable from it. But even so, like &lt;em&gt;Liz and the Blue Bird&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; it’s kind of hypnotizing in a bad way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knife in the Water (1962)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — psychological masterpiece by Polanski.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Battle After Another (2025)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — good in all the essentials, but I have no interest in swallowing what it’s delivering.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning (2025)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — inseparable from the extraordinary theatrical experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Beyond (1986)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — nothing to write home about, but sufficiently fun horror flick.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Holdovers (2023)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — probably going to become a Christmas classic, and another truly empathetic piece from Alexander Payne. Devastating stuff.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Point Break (1991)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — Swayze is phenomenal but I can’t get over Keanu. Really ballsy movie though; up there with &lt;em&gt;Die Hard&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as a solid A-tier action classic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Days of Thunder (1990)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — average but I’ll eat up anything with Cruise in it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goodbye, Dragon Inn (2003)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — masterful meditation on emptiness and the art we leave behind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — maybe my favorite western? One of the great American nostalgia movies and the originator of so much of the bromance magic that the movies today themselves lament…&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Long Day Closes (1992)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — a bit boring but ultimately great exploration of sadness, grief and living at a time when living felt weighty. You can feel the sadness poring through the glass. What a world we created.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death Ray on Coral Island (1980)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — obviously it sucks but I was the one who translated it to English, so I love it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dragon Inn (1967)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — not my favorite Wuxia but obviously one of the classics. The stuff with the inn is really something.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fist of Fury (1972)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — honestly a masterpiece. Bruce Lee enveloped in shadow is startling imagery; some of the most visually compelling scenes of all time. He’s a god.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smokey and the Bandit (1977)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — if every film was this fun we’d be in paradise. Here’s to zigzagging through cops in that Alabama sunshine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aloha (2015&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;) — very misunderstood film with a truly experimental approach to dialogue that doesn’t always work, but when it does it screams ELECTRIC.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silver Linings Playbook (2012)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — one of my new favorites, one of the best love stories of the 2010s and a film that truly respects mental illness and provides all the right coping mechanisms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stuff (1985)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — fun ‘80s schlock with an excellent anti-capitalist message.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yannick (2023)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — probably too French for me but a perfectly fine way to spend an hour.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 8 Diagram Pole Fighter (1984)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — action choreography had me drooling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Ninja (1985)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — underrated pulp classic. Not a film that should necessarily be watched, but a film that should exist to be found by unassuming 8th graders.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bloodsport (1988)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — dad classic, on the list—my kids are gonna see it day one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F1 (2025)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — the best &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; sports movie of this decade (&lt;em&gt;Challengers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as romance&#x2F;drama, of course).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invincible (2006)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — schlock but Wahlberg sports schlock will never fail to make me cry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Secret World of Arrietty (2010&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;) — not my favorite movie but there was a making-of segment after this that made me cry as to how much it meant to the ones making it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love &amp;amp; Pop (1998)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — truly disturbing masterpiece about the modern world, more relevant than ever. The cruelty people inflict upon each other is heartbreaking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bee Movie (2007)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — the absurdity of the bee jokes really got me so I can’t say this is all that bad in good conscience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters (1985)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — excellent but meant for people who don’t know Mishima; I already knew everything in it so didn’t hit me too hard.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tokyo Decadence (1992)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — interesting Ryu Murakami thriller about enforced depravation, but too pornographic for my taste.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Book of Life (1998)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — nothing too special but I’ll never hate a movie with the message that people are fundamentally good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moonrise Kingdom (2012)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — one of my new favorites and one of the greatest, most heartwarming portraits of young love ever put on screen. If I could live in it I would.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — first 3&#x2F;4ths is a complete masterpiece and probably the funniest movie I’ve seen in a long time but it builds up to a climax that it can’t live up to and falls apart.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love Exposure (2008)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — jesus christ I can’t believe this was made, but I’m glad it was. Truly operatic epic about what it means to love and another masterpiece.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Leaf (1971)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — I mean the studio fucked up her movie, but it could have been genuinely genius if they let May get away with it. Increased my reverence for her even though I didn’t love it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julien Donkey-Boy (1999)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — true masterpiece about mental illness, but I can’t put into words how awful it makes me feel about the injustices people have to suffer through.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghost in the Shell (1995)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — ahead of its time then but not anymore, although still extraordinary as a vibe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art School Confidential (2006)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — very funny in the beginning but doesn’t know what to do with itself after the tonal shift.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lobster (2015)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — not my thing but very lovely and heartwarming.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rouge (1987)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — sad, sad stuff walking Anita Mui walk through the bus stop quietly devastated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me and You and Everyone We Know (2005)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — queen of quirk obviously but very heartwarming stuff about love and the many ways in which it manifests.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2046 (2004)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — maybe Kar-Wai’s best? The Zhang Ziyi segment is tremendous.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lady from Shanghai (1947)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — mostly boring melodrama culminating in the greatest 15 seconds of any ending ever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mirrored Mind (2005)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — astonishing vibe cultivation but can’t make heads or tails of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Winnipeg (2007)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — sucks. College student film vibes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Last Days of Disco (1998)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — one of my new favorites, and Stillman’s masterpiece about growing up and finally needing to do something with your life. Soundtrack is something else.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irma Vep (1996)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — the only movie about what movies actually &lt;em&gt;are&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, fundamentally: compelling images.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afternoon Breezes (1980)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — so sad that it borders on abusing the viewer, but it’s a lament worth making.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demonlover (2002)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — kind of tailor-made for my sensibilities so I can’t really judge it but yeah this is dope.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April Story (1998)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — love how Iwai treats his characters with dignity. Very very cute.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pumping Iron (1977)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — more inspirational than &lt;em&gt;Rocky&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wild at Heart (1990)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — no words. Masterpiece.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Napoleon (2023)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — ugh, why make a movie about a guy you thoroughly hate?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;French Fried Vacation 2 (1979)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — hilarious shit and good prep for France.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — I mean I’m not going to say it’s a masterpiece or anything but I really did enjoy it, and the opening montage was excellent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Beast (2023)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — still mixed feelings. I hate what it’s doing but can’t look away.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twins (1988)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — surprisingly fun buddy comedy, and solidifies Schwarzenegger as one of the great actors of our time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Witches of Eastwick (1987)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — really this is notable for blonde vs brunette vs redhead but it’s also perfectly entertaining stuff with some crazy zaniness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horrible Bosses (2011)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — perfectly satisfactory but nothing too special.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proximity (2020)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — awful Christian propaganda after a good start.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flight Risk (2025)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — good theater experience but haven’t thought of it since then.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wave (2015)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — good disaster film but not sincere enough for the hall of fame (&lt;em&gt;Twister&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deep Impact&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, etc).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoolander (2001)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — bit shallow outside of the iconic scenes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Another Teen Movie (2001)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — best swallowed as a bunch of short-form clips of the funny scenes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The VVitch (2015)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — sucks. Template for all the bad modern horror, does nothing with the premise. Should’ve just been shot like a regular Hollywood movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Face&#x2F;Off (1997)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — good Woo stuff and very entertaining.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Con Air (1997)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — now THAT’s a movie. True Bruckheimer masterpiece and a crowning jewel on the American film industry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Masculin Feminin (1966)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — extraordinary mise en scène but drags.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elf (2003)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — fun Christmas romp with a good message and a funny Zooey Deschanel.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Goldfinch (2019)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — probably a template for why movies and books are different.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absolutely Anything (2015)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — very good stuff reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Click&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Be a good person.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indecent Proposal (1993)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — the worst version of what it could have been but with a plot like THAT there’s no way it can be bad, can it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wheels on Meals (1984)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — Jackie classic with the Benny fight almost the peak of his career.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anora (2024)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — overrated therapy schlock but it’s funny at times.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johnny Mnemonic (1995)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — not good but entertaining as an artifact of what sci-fi used to be as a genre.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empire Records (1995)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — loved it but it’s too cheesy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astro Boy (2009)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — objectively mediocre but has nostalgia vibes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (2001)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — Woody makes pulp! And surprise, surprise, it’s very good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Lieutenant (1992)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; — very good Ferrera but it’s so bleak that it borderlines on hate-watching.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;re-watches&quot;&gt;re-watches&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#re-watches&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: re-watches&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Films that I had watched before and decided to revisit this year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-change&quot;&gt;no change&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#no-change&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: no-change&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manhattan (1979) dir. Woody Allen&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was a 5, still a 5. Saw in theatres—still the greatest cinematography in an Allen film and maybe ever, and the central thesis of postmodern human existence in the mythological center of the universe is still as bleak as ever. 42 and dating a dating a 17-year-old while being in love with a girl who won’t commit; that’s the price of living in the greatest place on earth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dazed and Confused (1993) dir. Richard Linklater&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, still my favorite film of all time, yada yada yada. #1 through-and-through.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vertigo (1958) dir. Alfred Hitchcock&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structurally richer than I had previously noticed, but I also watched it with a girl who reminded me tremendously of my ex. What were the chances?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manchester by the Sea (2016) dir. Kenneth Lonergan&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably used to hold this to a bit more reverential standpoint, but it’s still a great deconstruction of masculine grief. What stood out to me on this viewing is just how much he’s trying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Will Hunting (1997) dir. Gus van Sant&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, one of the greatest to ever do it. Could watch it every day of my life and not get bored—I’m better at articulating why it’s that good now, however, and the answer is that Damon’s ‘solution’ to his dilemma is perfectly correct: your homies and the girl are, in fact, more important than your mathematical talents. Hits hard as a very young and disproportionately successful PhD student working in cryptography.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before Sunrise (1995) dir. Richard Linklater&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to stop watching this for a bit, honestly, being my perennial on-the-plane-to-Paris film, but I think I’ve extracted all there is to extract from it. Still great, though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Graduate (1967) dir. Mike Nichols&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another top 3 favorite, still there, no change. The greatest movie about being aimless ever made.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everybody Wants Some!! (2016) dir. Richard Linklater&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No change, still &lt;em&gt;Dazed&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;-lite. I do enjoy the lower stakes but it strips it a little bit of &lt;em&gt;Dazed&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;’s life affirmation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bahubali: The Beginning (2015) dir. SS Rajamouli&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfectly good romp—maybe less compelling than when I was 13, but still great stuff.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Star Wars Trilogy (1977-1983) dir. Several&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, it’s basically perfect, and I still believe that there shouldn’t have been a single additional piece of lore apart from whatever was contained in these. I don’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to know anything more about these characters. Things are only good because they end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Jobs (2015) dir. Danny Boyle&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still an underrated masterpiece, on par with &lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The lack of recognition is criminal. Everything about it is perfect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;even-better&quot;&gt;even better&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#even-better&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: even-better&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ocean’s Eleven (2001) dir. Steven Soderbergh&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, come on—nothing approaches this structurally, really, with the two overlapping plots of Danny getting the money and Danny getting the girl becoming inseparable from each other via an elaborate series of fake-outs. They’re one and the same, and interspersed in the middle are some of the coolest sequences of raw superhuman charisma put on screen. Not just a great film but a true masterpiece.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathless (1960) dir. Jean-Luc Godard&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used to be a good nouvelle vague film, now I think it’s the most important film ever made. Wrote a whole thesis about it in this article for High on Film.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eyes Wide Shut (1999) dir. Stanley Kubrick&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubrick’s best, and another bonafide masterpiece. Used to be scared by the party, now I’m scared by Alice’s confession. The only film that understands what being in an actual relationship is like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013) dir. Ayan Mukerji&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watched with my dumbass white American friend, which was funny, but HOLY SHIT does it have good music. Really, never noticed just how great the music was.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risky Business (1983) dir. Paul Brickman&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intricacies of how this deals with Reagan-era capitalism just went over my head on previous viewing; this is the perfect synthesis of red scare-era excess and a truly rich-suburban fantasy. One of those films that takes place in a world so divorced from the current one that it’s hard to believe this was ever really a thing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mallrats (1995) dir. Kevin Smith&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say what you want, this might be the funniest mainstream studio film of all time, and it gets funnier with each year I gain. Hits hard when you actually just are living the slacker lifestyle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;worse&quot;&gt;worse&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#worse&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: worse&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Fidelity (2000) dir. Stephen Frears&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t hate it or anything but unfortunately he’s uncool and a little annoying, and the film registers as a bit mopey when you’re older. It’s fundamentally still a nice little film, though—just not the life-defying one it used to seem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Colors: Red (1994) dir. Krzysztof Kieślowski&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still think this is genius, but I’m not as moved by its purely compositional nature as much anymore—more so by the way the plot works around everything. The thematic dual to &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; the external to &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;’s internal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;conclusions&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusions&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusions&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pretty good year in terms of cinema, all things considered—widespread variety in terms of genres and origin (did a lot of Hong Kong action and Asian cinema in general this year) along with my usual 80s-90s stuff.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things I have for next year that I’d like to do:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More Hong Kong. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite genres, and I need to complete the classics.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less Romance. I think I watch too many of these ‘doomed romance’ films, and I’m also running out of them. For them time being I’ll hope to focus on other aspects of cinema.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More 80s-90s genre schlock. As much as I love these I don’t do enough of them.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More European cinema. I’ve lost track of a lot of this and I’m not done with the classics, but as I learn French better next year I’ll probably start spending increasing amounts of time watching these.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slightly more experimental works. I’ve stuck to very standard things this year, but as I have access to more cinemas around here I’ll probably spend more time watching those.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More 70s drama. The American New Wave still can’t be beat.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directors I plan to watch more of&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Robert Altman, Woody Allen, Mike Nichols, Peter Bogdanovich, John Woo, Akira Kurosawa, David Cronenberg, Ang Lee, Eric Rohmer, Lars von Trier, Michael Mann&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Year’ defined in terms of &lt;em&gt;year of existence&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, my 21st, rather than calendar year, which corresponds approximately to 1 Nov 2024 - 31 Oct 2025. This is a significantly nicer metric, partly because it begins on the onset of winter and ends with the closure of fall; the calendar year has the annoying problem of starting something like 2&#x2F;5ths of the way through winter in most regions of importance. I hate January and prefer not to think about it. Pardon the pedantic intrusion, but this is one of the more important problems facing humanity in the great 2025; there are far too many jurisdictions in which the following pattern is not well followed: January—coldest, February—still cold but better, March—beginning of spring, April—spring proper, May—pre-summer, June—summertime. The local calendars must be shifted to accommodate for this. If we are able to survive with different time zones, why can we not survive with different date zones?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astonishing how versatile rapper slang is, no? I’ve been trying to sneak ‘God bless the man I put this ice over’ into conversation recently to little avail.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, art is not subjective: &lt;em&gt;Ocean’s Eleven&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a masterpiece, and if you disagree you are wrong.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;4&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patently ridiculous arguments, of course—&lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is an unbelievably good action film, and part of the reason for this is the way that it is shot to maximize theatrics at the expense of logical&#x2F;shot consistency, which is always a good choice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;modernart&amp;#x2F;pi.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I did two modern art&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; things: first, I went to the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parisinternationale.com&#x2F;visiting&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paris Internationale&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; exhibition on recommendation of a friend of mine. Second, I visited a private artist’s residence (as part of a small group), where the artist in question explained her process and her ideology, and the meaning of some of her works. I came out of these experiences with two observations:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never in my life do I feel more claustrophobic than while in the presence of contemporary artworks—as much as I like the idea of exhibitions, I have yet to go to one where I did not instantly feel the desire to flee.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have less than zero interest in understanding the process of how art is created, regardless of the medium&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;. As far as I care, all art traces its lineage either to the big bang following which it simply fell out of the sky fully-formed, one day, or it was produced by creator during the literal worst moment of their life as a sudden epiphany, scrawled with charcoal onto the back of a love-letter they found lying under a bridge as they prepared to end their life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will now elaborate on these two things in tedious detail.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;people-should-make-art-about-football&quot;&gt;people should make art about football&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#people-should-make-art-about-football&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: people-should-make-art-about-football&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the strongest reason as to why I find myself alienated in exhibitions is because nearly everything I encounter at these events screams “this is not for you” to me similar to how I would imagine my ex-girlfriend used to feel while attending soccer games with me. She was always somewhat apprehensive at these events—this manifested in quite a number of ways, especially in the form of asking questions which I was somewhat baffled as to how to answer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;modernart&amp;#x2F;soccer.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What am I supposed to do?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Well, I mean, watch the game, obviously.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But am I supposed to cheer?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Yeah, at the right moments.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the right moments?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; You’ll see. We’ll all be cheering at those. Usually when someone scores a goal.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So I wait till someone starts cheering?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Sure.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But then how do all of you simultaneously know you’re supposed to cheer at a particular moment?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; I’m not really certain, but, I mean, it depends on what our team is doing.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. Will your friends be annoyed if I cheer at the wrong thing?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Definitely not. They want you there, you know. They’re going to love it if you’ll be there. They’ll be stoked to see you, they’ll try to make it as nice as possible.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hmm, but on some level they also don’t want me there.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; In the sense that it’ll be a bit annoying if you’re doing the wrong things, yeah, but trust me, they want you there.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I wear?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Well, I mean, whatever you want.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, I’ll wear my new top, then.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Wait, isn’t that blue? Don’t wear that, that’s Man City’s color.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what do I wear?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Red anything works.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your friends scream a lot.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Yeah, but that’s kind of how these things work.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t get it. It’s thirty minutes in, and nothing’s happened.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Wait, what? So much has happened. Didn’t you see Bruno miss ten minutes ago?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is so stupid. I don’t get it. What are you getting out of this?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Yeah we’re down 4-0… honestly, no idea.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ooh, I like that guy, #7. He’s cute.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Yeah, that’s, uh, Cristiano Ronaldo. He’s probably the greatest player in the world.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what I mean? This is basically my experience at exhibitions—there’s usually something there that I can synthesize, but a lot of it just goes entirely over my head, and the rest is there merely to alienate. Weird people dressed in off-putting ways, discussing things I can barely comprehend.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my first instinct is that there must be something I’m missing, which is true—the analogy I would draw here is an IT professional like my dad, for instance, visiting a cryptography conference. It’s not like there’s nothing he can gain from this, but by and large he does not possess the necessary skills required to gain the most out of this experience. In the sense of artists being in conversation with other artists, this is more or less true for me. My interest in art is merely passing and largely gained from frequenting museums and exhibitions. But unlike a technical field such as cryptography, for instance, it should not be the case that I obtain precisely nothing from looking at these works. Consider movies: you can show something like &lt;em&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to a regular person and they would be able to piece something about it together; the experience is not entirely devoid of appeal, and even a more experimental work like, say, &lt;em&gt;On the Silver Globe&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, atrocious as it is, can be of interest to non-cinephiles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a lot of these exhibits at the &lt;em&gt;Paris Internationale&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; seem to be pretty much nothing at all, and even in the cases where I can see what they’re doing they don’t seem to be accomplishing their function effectively&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;. Consider this piece by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.evafabregas.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Eva Fàbregas&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;modernart&amp;#x2F;sculpture.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;A scuplture I saw at the exhibition, designed by [Eva Fàbregas].&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which is accompanied by the following description:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with soft and malleable materials, Eva Fàbregas’ practice embraces tactile engagement, physical intimacy, sensorial relation and multiple forms of somatic experimentation with and through objects. Liberated from the constraints of biology, desire and affect are allowed to flow in all directions, blurring the distinction between organic and inorganic matter. In her practice, touch is a primary source of knowledge. Her work is about learning through one’s fingers and the sculptures are often reminiscent of body organs and voluptuous glands, but she also looks at prosthetics as well as non-human life-forms such as corals, polyps and the reproductive parts of plants. Fàbregas’ work belongs to the realm of the somatic, the experiential, the guttural and the unnamable. It aims to fully inhabit the world of the senses, invoking a pre-linguistic stage to imagine other possible bodies, other ways of feeling, caring and being in the world&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4&quot;&gt;4&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying idea here is not only clever, but really something very interesting in what it attempts to show: &lt;em&gt;liberated from the constraints of biology, desire and affect are allowed to flow in all directions, blurring the distinction between organic and inorganic matter.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; I can see how the bulbous sculpture certainly looks like something that accomplishes this feat, but ultimately I am driven to boredom because it doesn’t seem to tell me anything at all about desire, affect, or the constraints of biology, which is what it promises. And this is a piece I don’t even dislike!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what else accomplishes this? JG Ballard’s &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t really articulate Ballard better than Mark Fisher does it, but the underlying ethos of artificiality in human sensuality induced by capitalism is quite unbelievable in &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which has innumerable things to say about every single one of the aforementioned things (and paints a pretty bleak portrait of them). But just because &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is able to do this well doesn’t mean that an art piece can’t—the purpose of this was merely to show that the artwork isn’t attempting to do something impossible. Great—that’s is a start.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next impulse is to say that &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is, of course, a narrative form in the way that the sculpture isn’t, and it is undoubtedly true that narrative forms are better at doing the things that I want them to do. It is not hard to tell that I am a narrative form guy. I like books and movies. If that is to be considered, it’s not like I didn’t gain anything from the above sculpture—I liked looking at it, and even before reading the description it did feel like something weirdly biological, so I’m not being thrown off entirely. But then there’s things like this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;modernart&amp;#x2F;thing.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;A scuplture I saw at the exhibition, presented by [Galerie Krinzinger].&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, I don’t know what this is or why it’s good or why it’s being shown to me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My limitations with experiencing non-narrative forms are a bit more general—it is also true that I find it a bit hard at art museums in general, though I think that might be a sensory perception issue; there’s too much I’m being bombarded with at any given moment, and by and large I enjoy looking at Monets and Van Goghs and Modiglianis. But it is also true that I mostly just like looking at them. Sometimes this takes a more cerebral slant, such as when I went to the Rothko chapel in Houston, way back in 2023, which consisted of a meditation room full of canvases painted pure black. Ideally this is the kind of thing I would think is stupid, but it turns out that I very much enjoy Rothko. First of all, he’s very good at putting me to sleep, which is an accomplishment on its own; I believe the purpose of his painting is to set a meditative mood, and I’m not being wry when I say that accomplishing this effectively is hard, and he does it very well. I am indeed moved by his musings on color as an object unto itself. The same is true for Andy Warhol, who is one of my favorite artists of all time:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;modernart&amp;#x2F;marilyn.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Warhol&amp;#x27;s Marilyn Monroe prints, famously about ‘liking things.’&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying sentiment here really is profound—Marilyn Monroe is very attractive, and I like looking at her, so I will look at her 50 times in different colors. That’s what pop art is, according to Warhol; “pop art is about liking things.” Isn’t that great? And, unlike &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, it’s also just a static image, which shows that static images are &lt;em&gt;good&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; at expressing certain things. It’s just that barely any of the stuff I seem to see at the exhibition accomplishes this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess my underlying takeaway from the exhibition is that artists don’t care about the things I care about. The good thing about the narrative form is that it can express anything that a static form can represent while also being entertaining, which is perhaps a pretty Warholian sentiment, on the whole. Cinema has &lt;em&gt;Sátántangó&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, sure, but it also has &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and the point is &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; really is a very effective method of communicating certain themes. Maybe democratizing art isn’t that bad, after all—only all I see is either pretentious installations in upscale exhibitions or drivel from amateur artists online, and not really interesting forms of ‘democratic’ art that do what &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is doing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I said to my friend upon completing the exhibition:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a question, how come all these artists are always talking about subverting things or challenging expectations or dealing with underrepresented classes and they all make the same transgressive sex outcast stuff?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never see any art about football&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which she replied that I should take a look at the art of Matthew Barney, who famously makes art about football. Now I do know this guy, partly because he’s a famous avant-garde filmmaker and partly because Kanye called him Jesus at some point, and so I went in with high expectations. Here’s some of the football art:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;modernart&amp;#x2F;football.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;A still from *Secondary*, Matthew Barney’s re-enactment of a devastating tackle that left a player paralyzed.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it good? I don’t know, but I think this is probably the ultimate illustration of my previous sentiment about artists not caring about what I care about. What this piece is supposed to show is the masculine violence inherent in football. The problem is that I don’t care about the masculine violence inherent in football, I care about football, and after going through his work I have come to the conclusion that Matthew Barney cares about masculine violence more than he does about football. When I care about football I care about life-and-death greatness. I care about the game that DeLillo compared to nuclear war. I like the aesthetics of masculine violence in football, but when, like, &lt;em&gt;Remember the Titans&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; does it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I do believe that there’s some manner in which the whole thing can be worked out effectively. Therefore I have decided to become an artist specializing in football. My first exhibit is a conceptual one: a complete collection of jerseys worn by all players during a single game framed and exhibited in a row as an illustration of what the shirt means and what damage they take during the game. Obviously, this is lowbrow, prole stuff—most of what I gain from football is best gained by simply watching the game, and this is not really a substitute for that—but that’s the point. This is commercial art for morons like me; the &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of art, some would say, and I’m willing to bet that there are more guys out there who are going to be moved to tears upon witnessing this exhibit than the sum total of guys moved to tears at the &lt;em&gt;Paris Internationale&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; exhibition; though I suspect that if ‘number of guys moved to tears’ is the metric for artistic success, I don’t think it’s possible to do better than simply a television screen playing the same 30-second clip of Messi winning the world cup on loop.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-process-is-not-the-point&quot;&gt;the process is not the point&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-process-is-not-the-point&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-process-is-not-the-point&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other experience was more interesting, and perhaps more fruitful—I visited the house of a Mexican-born artist now living permanently in Paris, who works on abstract impressionism. This was part of a group of ten people. While I wasn’t the biggest fan of the art (although I did not dislike it) the experience itself was very interesting, and demonstrated innumerable things about what goes on in the mind of artists, while also demonstrating to me once and for all that I genuinely don’t care.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, I had a &lt;em&gt;French Dispatch moment&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: similar to how Adrian Brody chastises the art collectors for disliking modern art by illustrating that the artist indeed possesses superior knowledge of technique—they are able to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nMdkF4Foirg&quot;&gt;‘draw a perfect sparrow’&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;—the artist in question talked about how she used to make naturalistic sketches with charcoal and ink before arriving at her current works, and those sketches were indeed very very good renderings of people and the human body. Her new stuff is largely things like a single inkblot on a canvas. Now whether this actually does represent her themes is up to interpretation, but the &lt;em&gt;art world&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; certainly thinks it represents her themes, and I’ll leave it at that—since I have different priorities than them I can’t evaluate stuff the same way they do. However, this is a person who is not a hack by any means. She is very talented and very insightful, and knows a lot more about art and painting than I do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;modernart&amp;#x2F;figs.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I was shown a video meant to represent the ways in which women are ‘freed’, which consisted of videos of figs being broken open set to an audio of women gasping and moaning. I don’t think there’s anything I need to explain here—it’s quite straightforward, really, but the audience didn’t seem to think so. When she asked what our interpretation of this work was there was a guy who said that the fig has a strong historically feminine connotation, including how it is pollinated by the wasp, and so on, and while I do think this is not at all a bad observation I think it just serves to show how hollow the whole concept of symbolism is. The artist did not think of this; she was more attuned to the visual image of the fig—what it &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; like—and based her artwork on that (I personally would agree that this is a better approach—certainly it’s the one I take). My broad problem with symbolism is perhaps my problem with art in general, which I guess just &lt;em&gt;is&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; symbolism in some sense—simply establishing the symbol doesn’t tell me anything about it. Consider, for example, a famous sense in which the fig is associated with womanhood, Plath’s fig tree analogy:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn’t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me the fact that it is a &lt;em&gt;fig&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; tree is quite inconsequential; the analogy works just as well if it’s an apple tree, because it does not require the symbolism of the fig to do the heavy lifting. In fact, the fact that it’s a fig tree may very well be the least interesting part of the whole expression as a whole. But art seems to be profoundly concerned with the fact that it’s a fig tree in particular, and it is difficult for me to ascribe meaning to this connection in isolation, even if it is &lt;em&gt;symbolically&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; correct.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this problem even when symbol makes its way to metaphor or allegory. Fine, the apple is a biblical symbol, forming a tether to the Garden of Eden. Okay, and? If the work continues the allegory, I will similarly find it empty and devoid of richness because unless there is some radical step that brings to forth completely new interpretations of Genesis I could simply just read Genesis—which possesses all the thematic and psychological richness I need, because that’s not an ‘allusion,’ it’s just the work itself. If that’s the case, I probably just am the wrong person to admire art. I do like Biblical art, if that helps. If I walk into a cathedral I am profoundly moved, but I guess that simply is the ‘art for proles’ that I was talking about; something visceral that affects you at once, and makes you repent and believe in God for as long as you’re within the cathedral’s doors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next piece that the artist showed us was a collection of scratchings on a page which she had made while listening to music, and at this point I could barely follow anymore because if taken without the context of the music (as they were exhibited during the actual exhibition) I cannot make heads or tails of this. Which is why I state that the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; gone into the art pretty much contributes nothing to my personal experience, unless it is a life-or-death matter—or rather, unless it’s a &lt;em&gt;story that is as rich as the story expressed by the art itself&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. What I suspect I’m doing here is aestheticizing this process and synthesizing itself as an extension of the artwork, but if this story is somehow less interesting than the art I just don’t care about it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I was doing this, and I had this idea’—I just can’t be bothered to care. Ultimately, it is never of much consequence to me what the author intended by a piece of work because the only way I can experience it is the way I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; experience it. Sometimes it’s nice to know what they intended, but what is fascinating to me is only how I experience it myself. My take is the one I care about, and the take of other people who I know and care about and believe say interesting things, such as my friends or such as some reviewers I follow online. And I suspect this is why all these stories about production never have much allure to me as they do to other people. ‘Hey, Stanley Kubrick actually shot &lt;em&gt;Eyes Wide Shut&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in London, not in New York City!’ And…? What am I supposed to do with this? Does it contribute to my experience of the film at all? Does it serve to illustrate how much of a genius Stanley Kubrick was? Evidently not, because I’m sure he could’ve achieved whatever he wanted to achieve simply by shooting in NYC, he was just lazy, and sure that’s funny, but that’s all it is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it seems like this is an integral part of the experience of contemporary art—the work itself should stand in isolation, and very often I am frustrated by works if I see the human flaws inherent in them. I don’t want to see the places where &lt;em&gt;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (one of my favorite movies of all time) falls apart. I don’t want to know how Disney made it. The film feels almost impossibly old, and I would prefer to think that this is an artifact that existed since the beginning of time and encodes something fundamental about the human condition in its pages; I would be a lot more interested in the story of its creation if it was a story of its discovery, for instance, wrought forth from Earth like Tutankhamen’s tomb, but that is untrue, and so inconsequential. I am not a theist, but it would be nice if it had its origin in God and not humankind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had these experiences and they proved rather hollow, honestly, and while they did teach me about the things I like about art I must conclude that pretty much everything about the art world seems to prioritize things that I don’t care about at all, and this is not really for me, and that’s okay—there are enough artists out there without me joining their folds, and I am happy to keep reading my books and watching my movies; &lt;em&gt;The Stranger&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, most recently, which I am planning to make the object of my next essay, and which partakes in very little symbolism and rather states its themes through the narrative, and therefore is something I believe I have quite an interesting grasp on indeed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;modernart&amp;#x2F;adam.png&quot; &gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I know it is called &lt;em&gt;contemporary&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; art, not modern art, but the phrase is a nice catch-all and rolls off the tongue better—if Joyce has taught me anything, it’s that the most important attribute of a phrase &lt;em&gt;is&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; how it rolls off the tongue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few exceptions. Van Gogh is the obvious one. Although even the actual painting itself is usually extraordinary, knowing that he was hallucinating while making it strongly adds to the allure; you can say that in this case the art isn’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the paintings, but also what went into making it. Somewhat like &lt;em&gt;Fitzcarraldo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which is otherwise quite average as a movie. But both of these examples have a strong case as representatives of ‘worst moment of artist’s life’ paradigm I outline in the rest of the point.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps effectively is the wrong word; it is not the function of art to illustrate its point as well as possible, but in any case, certainly there should be some potency in how it does illustrate its point?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;akerman&amp;#x2F;jeanne.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take the Paris tram to work every day and yet I did not notice until recently that one of the stops along the T3b is called ‘Delphine Seyrig,’ presumably after the actress-cum-filmmaker best known for being &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; or as the unnamed woman in Resnais’s &lt;em&gt;Last Year at Marienbad&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—the latter of which I have not and am in no hurry to watch because I am quite decidedly not a fan of either the former or Resnais’s other oft-considered masterpiece &lt;em&gt;Hiroshima Mon Amour&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I have been, to some extent, scrutinized for disliking &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The film most recently topped the new Sight &amp;amp; Sound poll in 2022 and has thus scored an ‘official’ point towards the designation of the greatest of all time: a statement I purport to be both ridiculous and self-defeating as well as a legitimate example of true intellectual snobbery (some amount of cultural tastemaking and gatekeeping is good for the form, but this particular phenomenon really borders on parodic). So this article is an attempt to put this misconception to rest once and for all: neither do I think that Chantal Akerman is a bad filmmaker (in fact I think she is really very talented and intelligent) nor do I think &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a bad work of art. But there are things I have to say about this film and its position in the canon regardless, and several of these things are quite negative and not very nice to hear—they play strongly at what my own personal notion of the ‘cinematic form’ is and are derogatory towards people who perceive cinema as something starkly different from what I purport to understand it as. Yet I will say them, and because they quite directly address certain talking points I find tiresome and generally prefer not to engage with I will not hold back but lay them to rest once and for all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;you-ll-never-walk-alone&quot;&gt;you’ll never walk alone&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#you-ll-never-walk-alone&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: you-ll-never-walk-alone&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complications that arrive while determining the position of &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in the cinematic canon arise from what is essentially a mismatch between intended and actual viewership. Barely anyone who watches this film is actually attempting to engage with this in the level that Akerman intends, I believe, a fallacy which is best exhibited by the constant proclamations of this film as a feminist masterpiece. This is not technically wrong—the film is, by nature, a feminist film—but in function the way that this designation is used is really quite incorrect. Here is the gist of it: &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; cannot be a film about the extraordinarily demeaning and sexist nature of domestic work because the titular Jeanne is not an accurate representation of a housewife.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that the film doesn’t deal with sexism or the ways in which women are demeaned. It simply means that it cannot do so on a level that has to do with the performance of domestic labour. What I am also not trying to say is that individuals with Jeanne’s problems don’t exist in this world—they certainly do, and they are to be pitied and empathized with, and it is a grave mistake on part of society that we do not help them. But the lens through which &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; views domestic labor is completely at odds with how domestic labour actually manifests in this world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I talk about on this blog is often filtered through my perspective on societal functioning, which I suppose can be broadly cast as ‘communist’ but in a manner that is closely linked to yet different from what the symbolic definition of that word now is. It is easy to think of ‘socialism’ and ‘communism’ and imagine failed brutalist states, mass hunger and ever-rising taxes. But the words possess a literal meaning to them as well—they contain ‘social’ and ‘commune’ in them, and deal with the responsibility that society has to its individuals. It is easy to fall victim to the American ethos&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; of ‘each man for themselves’ and forget that society functions in a way that often has nothing to do at all with nations or forms of governance. We have responsibilities to our children and our neighbors, and as much as you hate the homeless drug addict on the street you would try hard to love him and help him if he was your son. This is not because of moral principles, but because of the raw, biological urge to love your children. Of course you love him. And you want him to be happy, and so you do what you can.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our principles only fail to synchronize when I try to claim that the government’s job is to ensure this responsibility, but it is not an unreasonable response to that question that the people who my taxes are going to help are not people who live in the same society I live in. In fact, that is a very good response—the technological and ecological complexity of the world is now so vast that ‘societies’ span far more people than you could ever consider being part of your tribe. But the underlying sense in which I use the word ‘communist’ has far more to do with this notion of community that I just prescribed. Human societies have a way of forming and genuinely working. Niches, like housewives, are not created in isolation. It is easy to think that the reason why the world sucks is because there are bad people who think the wrong way and cause problems. It is remarkably easy to watch &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and say, hey: look at how sexist men are, millions of women suffer like this every day. But these generalizations completely ignore the fact that society does not exist in a vacuum, and that these trains of thought have often developed for very strong reasons. In the case of housewives, the fact of the matter is that &lt;em&gt;housewives like Jeanne Dielman are far and few between&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. In reality, most housewives are extraordinarily social and constantly in conversation with other housewives: when they go on the street, when they go have tea with each other in the evening, when they cook together. Living a life like Jeanne does in the film is a recipe for breaking apart at the seams (which is, of course, exactly what happens to her). Such a society consisting of individuals largely like Jeanne could not effectively function, at least not in a world that allows a film like &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to exist. Does this mean that housewives are happy, or that they are not exploited? Of course not. But the manner of their unhappiness and unfreedom is something not expressed in the film, because Jeanne is not a typical housewife. She is far less &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; she does not possess any of the natural defenses conventional housewives possess against malaise and eventual suicide.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chantal Akerman is quite obviously a genius, and her own individual perspectives on the film are significantly more revealing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akerman called Jeanne Dielman a feminist film, but not a militant one: Jeanne is neither a role model nor an example of a victim&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This movie represents a problem that could be lived by a man as by a woman.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, the ‘problem’ that Jeanne possesses is not inherent to being a housewife, but rather the far more insidious problem of profound depression due to modernity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;akerman&amp;#x2F;ak.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to compare Jeanne’s problem in this film to the problem of the protagonist of &lt;em&gt;I Saw the TV Glow&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which is quite possibly the worst film I’ve ever seen in my life. The underlying attitude of this film is that of being cruel to those who do not have the power to express themselves; it is a film that is so utterly steeped in this capitalist ethos of hyperindividual self-actualization that its prescription to those who fail to actualize is deserved unhappiness and eventual death. What a nasty, horrible way to think! This is how modern capitalist society conceptualizes therapy: as an individual problem, as if it is your own duty to keep yourself healthy. If a person kills themselves, it they themselves that have wrought such a fate. Both Jeanne and the protagonist of that film have the same problem: they have fallen prey to profound depression due to existing as individuals under capitalism, and they do not possess the strength nor the support around them to propel themselves towards being saved. We do not see Jeanne talk to other housewives or participate in any society-wide activities, despite living in a Belgium in 1975 that consists of far more than merely people self-isolating on their cell phones all day. In effect, she has been reduced to a ‘loser’—a person who basically does nothing, and consequently is a negative void of existence. Jeanne has a horrific life and does nothing at all to fix it; it is not her fault that she turned out this way, but the fact of the matter is true regardless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between Chantal Akerman and Jane Schoenbrun, of course, is that one of them is a great filmmaker while the other is a hack, and in this case Akerman has a full and complete understanding of what her film is about. Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is an exercise in literalizing the passive weight of existence—a feminine counterpart to something like Radiohead’s &lt;em&gt;OK Computer&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, where the motions reveal an existence haunted by the melancholy and the everyday in the absence of genuine connection, in the absence of the real, in the absence of life-and-death danger until the existence itself becomes so decadent and heavy that it begins undoing itself. It is about how modern society makes it possible to lead such an existence, and how even a slight deviation towards life is enough to break the fragile human brain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; feminist, then? Unquestionably, because the decision to make the film in the manner of its current existence—that of being represented as the plight of a housewife—is inherently feminist, but it is a baser, more exhaustive form of feminism than a mere ‘display’ of perpetrated oppression. Akerman, again:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akerman, again:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understood the importance of the film many months after finishing it. In the beginning I thought I was just telling three days in the life of a woman, later I realized that it was a film about the occupation of time, about anguish: doing things in order not to think about the fundamental problem, that of being.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think it&#x27;s a feminist film because I give space to things which were never, almost never, shown in that way, like the daily gestures of a woman. They are the lowest in the hierarchy of film images.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could paraphrase it better, I would try.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility&quot;&gt;with great power comes great responsibility&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken as a meditation on existence, &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is obviously an exceptional piece of &lt;em&gt;art&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—it is able to successfully evoke the feelings it attempts to evoke. Perhaps even too successfully; the film is rather uniquely affecting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;akerman&amp;#x2F;inn.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where this becomes frustrating, however, in its evaluation as a piece of &lt;em&gt;cinema&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which is a lot murkier. There is more to cinema than pretty images, and I am not denying that &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is good cinema, but it is quite concerning that the so-called #1 greatest film of all time possesses exceptionally few qualities that have become staple of the cinematic form. The fact of the matter is that beautiful characters, whip-pans and crash zooms &lt;em&gt;are&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; cinema—laugh at them all you like, but this is exactly the power that cinema provides, which is something that &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; simply does not fully leverage. &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; can function as an art installation consisting of a series of stills, but something like &lt;em&gt;Breathless&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; could never be anything but a film; it is so utterly entrenched in the form so as to be inseparable from it. Must it not be so that the greatest films be so cinematic that the nature of what they communicate be inherently meaningless in the absence of the form?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the vast majority of critics watch &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and immediately categorize it to be one of the greatest movies of all time is a strong indictment of film criticism as an institution; it is astonishing that a film that possesses so few of the qualities that make cinema great is lauded as a top 10 masterpiece by nearly all critics—the lack of institutional diversity which proves, yet again, that whatever ‘white male’ school of criticism used to exist has now been replaced by an equally performative group that still ascribes the highest grade to European bleakness. The playbooks are all the same: slow cinema, formal preciseness, an intensive obsession with pessimism and the negative. It is not that any of these things are inherently bad, but rather that they paint cinema as a dry, meditative enterprise, when it is the most dynamic art form to exist. Where do these qualities emerge? When were they elevated? Who knows? Who cares?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not the biggest fan of slow cinema, but there is several I like, regardless—Tsai Ming-liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien being the most straightforward examples, both of whose films often consist of nothing more than static images played after the other for a couple of hours. This is meditative thematic elevation not very different from something like Bresson or Tarr, but the purpose is not to &lt;em&gt;depress&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;— in fact, echoing the underlying buddhist principles of the societies from which these films emerge, the purpose is to create a meditative experience that brings you closer to the medium. The way this manifests is in terms of the actual films is the images that they choose to show. Why is it that the cinematic interiors of Ming-liang are less lauded than Akerman or Tarr? The answer is due to elevating bleakness to the peak of the form. I personally find this garish, really—think of our great auteur Paul Schrader, constantly wondering if anyone has made a better film than &lt;em&gt;Pickpocket&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Schrader himself has made at least five films better than &lt;em&gt;Pickpocket&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, because he takes the Shakespearean stance of American cinema—that it is possible to express things through good stories and good narratives, and though there is significant artistic and experimental merit in the form of expression employed by directors like Akerman, it is not what cinema does &lt;em&gt;best&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. There have been a gazillion movies made throughout history. The vast majority of them have been crappy pulp. Denying this fact is akin to denying cinema itself—it is not the masters that define the medium, but the medium that defines its masters. I will continue to laud &lt;em&gt;À bout de souffle&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as the greatest; the film that contains in itself more than any other all the things that are good and lovely about cinema—a film as tragic as &lt;em&gt;Jeanne Dielman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in what its Marxist undertones set out to describe, and yet a film that also has two people making love and pointing guns act each other. It is a culmination of everything cinema has the power to do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have decided to permanently quit the internet, for reasons I outlined in my previous post. This post is a log that deals with how I am actually accomplishing this goal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unfortunately not possible to completely go offline. I will need the internet to manage my bank accounts, book flights and other such logistics, and I also need access to national and international messaging apps for a variety of reasons. However, while these are part of the multimedia infrastructure and instrumental in modulating the way you think (managing bank accounts online, for instance, abstracts the idea of money from something concrete to a number on a webpage, and messaging apps ensure instant international connectivity—something completely invalid in the natural world) I do consider them morally seperate from the ‘hijacking’ tools the internet applies: ensuring that you are always in view of yourself, for instance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-phone&quot;&gt;my phone&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#my-phone&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: my-phone&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to eliminating internet usage is getting completely off my phone. Unfortunately, this has certain drawbacks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maps&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Obviously, it is possible to navigate without maps, but this requires certain amounts of effort. The reason why maps is one of those features integrated on a cell phone is because you really do need the modularity offered by the cell phone to use it effectively—you can log onto social media in your room (you do not need it while in a car) but maps allows you to navigate quite seamlessly. However, this can be mitigated in my circumstance. The fortunate fact is that I live in Paris and have a vague memory of the entire subway system and most of the city so can perform the ‘broad strokes’ of navigation by myself. If I have a specific goal in mind, then I can potentially accomplish this by using maps before I go to a certain location and then writing down directions. This sounds like a hassle, but I suspect this is one of those skills which gets exponentially better over time to the point that you do not really need maps anymore.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Booking Taxis&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Unfortunately (although I do not need this on the daily) I think this is one of those situations which requires me to actually keep a regular smartphone handy close by. The fact of the matter is that I travel a lot to places I&#x27;ve never been before, and require access to cabs. However, it looks like this is only the matter when I&#x27;m traveling—which isn&#x27;t all that much if considered on a day-to-day basis; I only travel once every few months, so I can probably whip out a phone whenever I need it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2FA&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I hate 2FA and intend to write a screed on it soon, but unfortunately it&#x27;s true—I need it all the time for a variety of reasons. There is never any explicit sitation occuring that requires to keep it on me, however, and my new login mechanisms aren&#x27;t as unwieldy as they used to be (in America my university required me to corroborate with the 2FA client every single time I logged into my email), so this can also be accomplished by ocassionally turning on a smartphone I keep stashed in the basement.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is this: I can keep my regular smartphone (shut down) stashed under the bed to be brought out in case of exceptional circumstances, and can walk around with a regular dumbphone that can&#x27;t run anything (namely android) on it instead. After some consideration I decided to get a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hmd.com&#x2F;en_int&#x2F;nokia-2660-flip?sku=1GF011NPC1A04&quot;&gt;Nokia 2660 Flip&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, since I&#x27;ve always wanted a flip phone. This pretty much has only calling, messaging, pictures (along with a flashlight and FM Radio, although I&#x27;m never going to use that) and an mp3 player, which is really all I need on a phone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside to doing this is largely that I &lt;em&gt;look&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; stupid, especially when I meet new people—it seems that people have become reluctant to the idea of simply sharing their phone numbers immediately, especially to some guy who&#x27;s painstakingly typing them out on a flip phone which can only message and make regular calls. But I suspect this would be alleviated since I&#x27;m not really going to quit messaging apps; to do so will be social suicide, and the point of this experiment is to ensure the exact opposite.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;camera&quot;&gt;camera&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#camera&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: camera&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big problem with not having your phone on you is that you don&#x27;t have a camera.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve thought about this, however, and it seems to me that there is pretty much no circumstance in which I will be &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and require a camera. If I&#x27;m out with friends, someone else will have a smartphone to take pictures with. If I&#x27;m alone and need a camera, I&#x27;m probably on a trip, or something, and I would do significantly better with having a legitimate camera on me. I dug out this &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;quittinginternet&#x2F;l&quot;&gt;old sony camera&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and it still works like a charm, and my MacBook has a nice SD Card slot to back up data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one notable exception is that often I need to scan documents or something. For this, I can just use my iPad, which is basically just lying at home all the time, and so is quite unproblematic—I never need to take pictures of documents on the fly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;money&quot;&gt;money&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#money&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: money&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In France, fortunately, everyone just taps their card to pay, so if I have my wallet on me I don&#x27;t need to worry about money.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a significant problem in India, however. The normalized method of payment in India is UPI, which functionally works like Venmo and essentially requires you to have access to a smartphone. There has been some improvement on this front—it looks like there are a lot of new dumbphones which support UPI payments—but it is still an annoying hassle that will have severely negative effects on the world in times to come. It&#x27;s reached the point where vendors basically refuse to take cash.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;social-media&quot;&gt;social media&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#social-media&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: social-media&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is stuff I absolutely need to get rid of. Unfortunately, I have accounts on too many of these things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;instagram&quot;&gt;instagram&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#instagram&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: instagram&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the one thing I really don&#x27;t want to deactivate, since it is actually useful. The problem with instagram is solely the stupid recommendation features and the dumb instagram reels—taken as a mechanism to keep in touch with people you know in real life, it&#x27;s really quite good, and its messaging feature is pretty useful when it comes to, like, dating. Despite being attention-span eating short-form videos, I have also found that reels (if curated correctly) are actually not that bad, either, though they must be quit permanently as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1 is to go through my instagram and unfollow everyone who is not someone I know in real life, to ensure that I do not see crap content which does not have to do with connecting with people. This is already something accomplished, because the amount of people I follow is quite large: stupid comedy podcasters, soccer journalists, daily Kanye quote channels, guys who are attempting to become illiterate, the morning routine guy, and so on. By far the worst was cutting access to Nastassja Kinski&#x27;s private account, however... she never replies to my DMs, but she used to follow me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Totally, this got me down from about 540 following to 367 following, which meant that the vast majority of my engagement on instagram was with people who I did not know.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this was done, I downloaded the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.distractionfreeapps.com&quot;&gt;distraction-free instagram client&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which basically disables all features excluding messaging and adding new people, which are the only things I really need. There&#x27;s a catch, however—I add new people on this with a fair amount of frequency, a significant amount more than I want to knock open my smartphone. The solution here is that I can install &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getcoldturkey.com&quot;&gt;cold turkey blocker&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and block access to all of instagram &lt;em&gt;except&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; two pages on the site:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DM page, which allows me to send messages to people, and&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The notifications page, which lets me view my notifications. In particular, I will be able to see people who sent me a follow request and follow them back without actually navigating anywhere else on the site. This is a clever solution, because if I meet someone I probably won&#x27;t have a smartphone on me anyway, and I can instead request &lt;em&gt;them&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to add me on Instagram, after which I can just add them back. This way I don&#x27;t need access to the search bar.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, barely using Instagram is a pretty good way to get people&#x27;s numbers, instead, which is always nicer—generally I hate texting and always prefer to call (since outside of the occasional group chat I really only text to set up calls&#x2F;real-life meetings), and not carrying a smartphone on me is a pretty acceptable reason to dial people up. They can&#x27;t get annoyed at someone who doesn&#x27;t use messaging apps with any amount of frequency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;twitter&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#twitter&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: twitter&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I signed up on this a while ago to make friends who share similar interests as me, but I really have just come to the conclusion that this is an irredeemable piece of crap. I nuked my account. These guys are so annoying that it actually takes 30 full days to accomplish this—you can&#x27;t even immediately get rid of the thing, you have to ensure that you haven&#x27;t logged in for a whole month before it actually removes all your content, and even then it doesn&#x27;t actually delete all your tweets! Possibly the worst invention in human history since firearms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To actually get rid of my tweets, I had to use &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tweetdeleter.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;delete-all-my-tweets&quot;&gt;Tweetdeleter&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, because there&#x27;s no native functionality on the Twitter app&#x2F;website to get rid of all your content. After this, I was able to deactivate my account.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reddit&quot;&gt;reddit&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#reddit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: reddit&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really annoying one because most of the &#x27;useful&#x27; content on the internet is on Reddit these days, since regular forums have all but died out. Because of this, I don&#x27;t actually have an account on it, but still use it with a fair amount of frequency!
Unlike most social media, this one basically allows you to get addicted without ever ensuring participation; at no point in my life have I ever wanted to type out a reddit comment, but it is still probably the thing I am most addicted to, anyway. Of all the things on the internet, Reddit is the most like reality TV, and the things that I consume on here probably cause the most mental damage—reading ridiculous arguments about soccer managers, witnessing people spiraling down into drug use, and reading posts about insane people reacting in neurotic ways (and just generally being losers) while other similarly addled people offer them advice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple problems here:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could just block the subreddits which I use too much: random subreddits for hobbies, books, soccer, politics and miscellaneous content like r&#x2F;redscarepod or r&#x2F;futurology which exists solely to feed my neurotic and fatalistic tendencies.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could get rid of the site entirely, but then have to deal with horrible SEO-optimized websites which don&#x27;t actually answer my search queries.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the correct answer is #2, and the reason for this is that the vast majority of these &#x27;essential&#x27; queries that I make are actually not essential whatsoever—my life could easily go on without ever needing such things, especially because I have a proclivity for endless amounts of doomscrolling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Cold Turkey and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.stayfocused&amp;amp;hl=en_IN&quot;&gt;Stay Focused&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I could keep Reddit off my phone and computer permanently, and I have done this successfully.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is my iPad.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other social media, I almost exclusively use Reddit when I&#x27;m at home, which means that my iPad is a source of danger—I can basically use it at all times. Unfortunately, Apple does not really provide &lt;em&gt;any&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; good mechanisms for permanently locking yourself out of the internet. Ultimately, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;quittinginternet&#x2F;#my-ipad&quot;&gt;I found a fix&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which works about as well as I possibly could make it work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#youtube&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: youtube&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately or unfortunately, I have never really been addicted to YouTube, so cutting it out is not hard. There are only three things I basically need YouTube for:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How-to videos&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The good thing is that the best how-to videos often appear as snippets on Google search, and can be played with an embedded viewer that doesn&#x27;t open the actual website.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gym Content, particularly Sam Sulek&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Unfortunately, I think I might have to give this up entirely. As much as I like listening to Sam, I really can&#x27;t think of a way to unblock this without also giving me access to the entirety of YouTube.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vlogbrothers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. After doing a bit of searching I realized that they have a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;6e4HNBdPvjDOHKVf82oMEk&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; I can listen to instead, which is probably better, anyway; I always thought that they would be better as a podcast.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;music&quot;&gt;music&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#music&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: music&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deactivated my Apple Music subscription and got a pair of wired earphones since I&#x27;m going to be running a dumbphone with an mp3 player on it. With an SD card, this should give me about a thousand or so songs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very fun, because I will now have to choose what songs to put on my phone, and will have to reload it or use FM Radio every time I want to listen to something else—and since I&#x27;m going to be in a non-english speaking country, I will probably be restricted to top 40 music. This is good! I have spent enough time listening to Car Seat Headrest or Deathconsciousness. I suspect I will be much happier listening to Drake.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am considering the Kanye and Lana discographies, along with some Bruce Springsteen and MGMT. It is nice to not be able to walk around with unlimited amounts of music. Since I don&#x27;t listen to music at home, I don&#x27;t see any reason why I would need to block Spotify or Apple music. Since I now have a podcast to listen to, I suspect this is something I could do while sitting at home instead of walking around, making life different. I have never really sat and listened to a podcast as a recreational activity, instead of something I do while, say, walking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;facebook&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#facebook&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: facebook&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t use Facebook apart from Marketplace, and it is already blocked everywhere on my computer and on my phone, so I am not doing anything to change that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;linkedin&quot;&gt;linkedin&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#linkedin&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: linkedin&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also now blocked on my computer, and again, I have no reason to actually unblock it, ever, because I am not looking for a job (nor have I ever used LinkedIn to look for jobs).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whatsapp-signal-etc&quot;&gt;whatsapp, signal, etc&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#whatsapp-signal-etc&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: whatsapp-signal-etc&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have decided to keep these messaging apps on my computer and on my iPad, because I will need them to talk to my parents and friends across continents.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is no reason I need to walk around with a smartphone just to use these. I do not need to call people who don&#x27;t live close to me at all times—any emergency can almost always be deferred to the end of the day. In case there is a significant problem, I have memorized their phone numbers, and can dial an international call; whatever amount of money that takes is offset by the fact that it&#x27;s an emergency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;discord&quot;&gt;discord&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#discord&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: discord&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deleted the app everywhere, but did not disable my account. I doubt I&#x27;m going to use this for any extended period of time but if I do I&#x27;ll just nuke the account. I&#x27;ve never used this extensively—it has nothing on it that makes me want to keep it beyond WhatsApp or Signal, except for the ability to watch movies or soccer games remotely. Although I used to have people to do this with I don&#x27;t really have anyone now, and if something happens and I do suddenly need to watch movies with someone remotely I&#x27;ll just install the app again. It&#x27;s too unintuitive and full of actual children for me to spend any real amount of time on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;letterboxd&quot;&gt;letterboxd&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#letterboxd&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: letterboxd&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the social media I was most unhappy to get rid of because I probably had the healthiest relationship with it. However, part of my screed against social media was also an attempt to get rid of consuming copious amounts of useless &lt;em&gt;information&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and that included movies. The problem is that I&#x27;m not really opposed to watching movies altogether; I just want to limit my consumption of them from my peak of 200 a year down to something like 30 or 40. A movie every other week is fine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main goal was to get rid of annoying discourse surrounding movies, which is also what I was primarily using twitter for. While I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily bad, the way this manifests is quite toxic in the literal sense of the word—this stuff poisons your brain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I had a bunch of good stuff on my Letterboxd account, including many reviews and pieces of writing that I enjoyed. My solution was to simply export my Letterboxd data to a CSV and leave the account as-is, while using all the techniques I already had at my disposal to block the website.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had a paid Patron subscription, which I canceled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I really needed was the watchlist and a method to search through the reviews, anyway, which I backed up.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;goodreads&quot;&gt;goodreads&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#goodreads&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: goodreads&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no love for Goodreads, and have found &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;reading&#x2F;&quot;&gt;better ways&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to track my books. I nuked my account.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-blog&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#this-blog&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: this-blog&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing about this blog is that no one is reading it :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can just keep access to this via GitHub and keep pushing changes; I don&#x27;t even need to really open a browser to write stuff on this. I have no plans to stop writing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-ipad&quot;&gt;my ipad&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#my-ipad&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: my-ipad&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are apps available to block stuff on iOS, but by and large they are quite unhelpful—they rely largely on Apple&#x27;s native screen time ‘content restrictions’ which can be easily bypassed, because the only level of security is a 4-digit passcode.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ONLY technique that I was able to determine worked sufficiently well was the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;apple-configurator&quot;&gt;Apple Configurator 2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; App—this is a content management system for iOS devices that are linked to a particular organization. If you have ever been given a ‘school’ iPad that seems to be all blocked and stuck exclusively to a single app, the way this was established was by using the Apple Configurator App, which requires you to physically connect your iPad to a Mac computer to override. The app allows you to essentially customize your iPad to whatever degree you want.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did was set up my iPad as a ‘supervised device’ (this involved completely erasing everything that was on it, however—so beware) and then basically removed Safari, a whole bunch of other browsers and apps, and added a series of websites as content restrictions. Furthermore, to remove the setup profile, I added a 34-digit passcode which I sent to a friend and told him to never reveal to me under any unexceptional circumstance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why I was able to do this is because I really only need three things on my iPad:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to transfer files onto it, which I could through Drive.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to recieve and send emails, and I kept Gmail on the device.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A note-taking app—I use &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodnotes.com&quot;&gt;Goodnotes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;—that supports Apple Pencil.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is ALL I do on my iPad, I do not require it for any other reason; a nice perk is that I was able to keep WhatsApp and Signal on it as well, along with some Rideshare apps in case I was feeling risque and wanted to travel somewhere without my phone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main deal is that I no longer have a browser on my iPad, so I can&#x27;t do anything stupid on it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I could just do the same thing to my phone instead of buying a new dumbphone altogether. However the form factor of my Phone makes it pretty easy to just plug it into my computer and reset it—it&#x27;s better to just not have the phone handy at all. I also don&#x27;t have an iPhone, but an Android phone, and I&#x27;m not really certain how to do such things on it; besides, I don&#x27;t know what additional functionalities are going to be limited by the fact that I don&#x27;t have a browser on my iPad, and I don&#x27;t want to take any risks like that on my phone—I still need everything to be accessible if &lt;em&gt;really&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; required.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the series of steps I had to take to block access to my iPad permanently. I don&#x27;t think you can actually do it without a MacBook, so take care.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I downloaded Apple Configurator 2 from the App Store.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I connected my iPad physically to my MacBook via a USB-C cable. The device popped up on configurator.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I erased my iPad via the prompt menu, and further removed the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-in&#x2F;108794&quot;&gt;activation lock&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. You need to do this to set up the iPad as a supervised device—since it already has stuff on it, you can&#x27;t set it up as a new supervised device. The activation lock is a mechanism to lock your iPad in case it gets lost; you need to disable it since you&#x27;re basically setting up an entirely new device. You can do this on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icloud.com&#x2F;find&#x2F;&quot;&gt;iCloud Find My Device&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; menu. Mine didn&#x27;t have any stuff on it, but you should probably back up your data to iCloud and download it onto your MacBook.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The iPad will restart with factory settings. Go through the setup, but don&#x27;t back up your data; this will restore your old iPad.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When it prompts you to enter an Apple ID, set up your device as a supervised device &lt;em&gt;first&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, then log in, otherwise it will again try to restore your old iPad.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should now be able to back up your data onto your iPad, while ensuring that it remains supervised.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the Configurator menu, set up a new ‘profile’—this is basically a set of rules ensuring what you can and can&#x27;t do. Make sure to make your profile unremovable without an administrator password, otherwise you&#x27;ll just remove it. Then add a really long and annoying password and write it down somewhere or give it to a friend.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should now be able to use the menu to make whatever changes you want to your iPad. I removed a bunch of browsers and then the App Store, leaving behind only the bare-bones things I needed. I also blocked a bunch of websites so any loopholes wouldn&#x27;t work. Essentially all I can do on my iPad now is import files via Drive and then write on them via Goodnotes; it&#x27;s basically a glorified notebook. I can also send and recieve emails to work with documents and use some messaging&#x2F;rideshare apps.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&#x27;re really determined, you might plug in your iPad again and try to reset the profile. There&#x27;s a simple way of preventing this: use &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getcoldturkey.com&quot;&gt;Cold Turkey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to block access to the Configurator app on your Mac; it&#x27;s much easier to block things on a Mac since it&#x27;s a real OS that allows you to do whatever you want on it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To keep things ‘technically’ usable, keep the block on except between 0413 and 0414. That gives you a one-minute window at 4 in the morning to reset the Configurator app, in case you&#x27;re having some kind of real emergency.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-am-i-going-to-do-now&quot;&gt;what am i going to do now&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-am-i-going-to-do-now&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-am-i-going-to-do-now&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this will give me many additional hours of newfound time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what I am going to do with this time. Quite possibly I will do absolutely nothing—I don&#x27;t have productivity issues, and am happy with the amount I work. I suspect that this is going to be a problem at first. Boredom does not really breed happy thoughts, although I will probably start spending significantly more time at work or outside instead of my house; constantly looking for things to do, people to talk to. Or I will just read an infinite amount of books.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I suspect that my brain will be ‘rewired’ to the point that I can start doing meditative hobbies for extended periods of time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know what this will achieve, but I am somewhat eager to find out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have never been to west Texas. But I have been to California and Nevada and Arizona and fallen in love with the neverending wastelands of the frontier. A not-insignificant part of my love of the United States&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; is a love for the &lt;em&gt;land&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; on which it lies—perhaps one of the singularly best pieces of land on earth, rivaled really only by the spectacles of China and India (although we over here seem to have smothered it with layers and layers of concrete). The nature of how land exists in America has always seemed to me to be strange and foreign, a reversal from my homeland in India where long expanses of civilization are interspersed with the occasional natural wonder. In the US it is entirely different. Most of the country is really just nothing. Drive long enough on the roads and maybe a city might pop up in a hundred or so miles, but more than likely it might be some sort of trailer park or a solitary dwelling occupied by people who have rare defiance of nature. In America you cross the horizon and see a city approaching in the distance. It is a sight otherwise impossible to find.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this barren desert—one of the hottest in the world—you find yourself occupied by the sheer &lt;em&gt;nothingness&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of your surroundings. It is enough to induce simplicity even amongst the most neurotic of men. Every night you can look up and see the Milky Way. This is where Delillo sends his protagonist Gary Harkness, a guard for Logos College and a recovering troublemaker, of sorts. Occupied to the brim with the threat of global thermonuclear war, Gary and his teammates attempt to use football to transform their minds into the autonomic ideal that forms the thought processes of all the best athletes: &lt;em&gt;nothing at all&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Penn State, the next stop, I studied hard and played well. But each day that autumn was exactly like the day before and the one to follow.

  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each day, for example, I spent some time in meditation. This never failed to be a lovely interlude, for there was nothing to meditate on. Each day I added a new word to my vocabulary, wrote a letter to someone I loved, and memorized the name of one more president of the United States and the years of his term in office. Simplicity, repetition, solitude, starkness, discipline upon discipline. There were profits here, things that could be used to make me stronger; the fanatical monk who clung to my liver would thrive on such ascetic scraps. And then there was geography. We were in the middle of the middle of nowhere, that terrain so flat and bare, suggestive of the end of recorded time, a splendid sense of remoteness firing my soul. It was easy to feel that back up there, where men spoke the name civilization in wistful tones, I was wanted for some terrible crime.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the remoteness helped me. The desert was an ideal place […] I spoke aloud to myself in the desert, straightening out my grammar, getting rid of the old slang and the old speech rhythms. I walked in straight lines. I tried to line myself up parallel to the horizon and then walk in a perfectly straight line. I tried to become single-minded and straightforward, to keep my mind set on one thought or problem until I was finished with it. It was hot and lonely. I wore a lot of clothing to keep the sun from burning me and causing my skin to peel. Sometimes I read aloud from a children’s reader. I wanted to start all over again with simple declarative sentences. Subject, predicate, object. Dick opened the door. Jane fed the dog. It helped me immensely. I began to think more clearly, to concentrate, to leave behind the old words and aromas and guilts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inner life must be disciplined just as the hand or eye. Loneliness is strength. The Sioux purified themselves by fasting and solitude. Four days without food in a sweat lodge. Before you went out to lament for your nation, you had to purify yourself. Fasting and solitude. If you can survive loneliness, you’ve got an inner strength that can take you anywhere. Four days. You wore just a bison robe. I don’t think there’s anything that makes more sense than self-denial. It’s the only way to attain moral perfection. I’ve wandered here and there. I’ve made this and that mistake. But now I’m back and I’m back for good. A brave nation needs discipline. Purify the will. Learn humility. Restrict the sense life. Pain is part of the harmony of the nervous system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the introduction to his book &lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Desert of the Real&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, consisting of five essays about 9&#x2F;11, Slavoj Žižek argues that the mental framework required to understand 9&#x2F;11 as an act has been sufficiently corroded by western understandings of democracy so as to be incomprehensible. He recalls a story about an officer of the German Democratic Republic stationed in Siberia, who attempts to communicate with those back home through the medium of letters, which are unfortunately subject to heavy censorship. So they make a plan: he will buy blue ink and red ink, and everything in blue ink is the truth while everything in red ink is false.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the following letter arrives home: “Everything is wonderful here; the shops are full, food is abundant, apartments are large and properly heated, cinemas show films from the West, there are many beautiful girls ready for an affair — the only thing that you cannot get is red ink.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story, according to Žižek, is one about how we feel free because we lack the very language to articulate our unfreedom. In the absence of red ink, the officer cannot even articulate the problems he experiences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the lack of red ink means is that, today, all the main terms we use to designate the present conflict—‘war on terrorism’, ‘democracy and freedom’, ‘human rights’ and so on—are false terms, mystifying our perception of the situation instead of allowing us to think it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is not new, but particularly well articulated in this instance. In his review of JG Ballard’s &lt;em&gt;Millennium People&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, Mark Fisher talks about how Ballard fully articulates why the failure of 9&#x2F;11 was because it was an act imbibed with ‘meaning’—as opposed to the acts committed by the protagonists of &lt;em&gt;Millennium People&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which are inherently meaningless. Such meaningless atrocities are now commonplace across the world. But reading these acts from Žižek or Chesterton’s perspectives brings to light something new: it is not true that the essential framework of postmodernism has eroded meaning altogether, but rather that the concepts which gave birth to modernity imbue themselves on our minds so well that they make understanding such acts impossible. In short: it is not true that 9&#x2F;11 as an act is devoid of meaning, it is simply impossible to understand from the perspective of the American mind. To understand 9&#x2F;11 would require being born to fundamentalists in the Middle East, having suffered a series of moral setbacks culminating in strong ties to al-Qaeda. From this perspective, it makes total and unequivocal sense.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The erosion of certain ways of thinking is not something that is unique to American hegemony, but has been strongly linked to it in the past years—and at least some scholars would agree that the violence Kissinger has perpetrated here may be far worse than the atrocities in Cambodia. The method through which these ideas were exported was through the export of language.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An essential comparison here is the decolonization of Africa. It is well known that African countries do not ‘make sense’—the instability of course, being that the borders were drawn &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by colonial powers who were not African and did not understand the African people; they were divided arbitrarily, pitting enemies into the same country to the point where most countries either collapsed, served as puppet states or went though stages of internal conflict until shadows of states rose out of the ashes. But the deeper instability here is that the notion of nation-state is simply not one that is applicable to Africa; why would it be? The nation-state is a predominantly &lt;em&gt;European&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; notion, borne out of people who were so tired of fighting wars for kings on the same soil again and again and again that they collectively agreed to create something new—not just a method of governance, but an entirely new method of &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, linked to an odious mixture of historical land, peoples and the shared history &lt;em&gt;of&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; governance. The Africans made no such choice. Neither did the Indians, nor the Chinese, nor did anyone else; the ‘successful’ Eastern nation-states such as China or the USSR were initiated into the status via enormously destructive communist revolutions, largely ridding all notions of historicity and ‘regressive’ culture (code for non-western culture) until a nation-state could be established. India, of course, having neither suffered the war nor the cultural revolution, is decidedly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a modern nation-state, and is hence strongly prone to pre-war style fascist nationalism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe there will be yet another war, sure, but this cultural export of nation-states was merely step one in establishing American hegemony. This is what Justin Smith-Ruiu has to say about the US in his latest article about politics:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I think of the United States these days, I find I slot it mentally somewhere next to the Soviet Union: a place that used to exist, and that in the previous century produced many artifacts and spectacles that can now be revisited virtually when you are feeling nostalgic. You can open up the box and watch snippets of &lt;em&gt;Oklahoma&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, for example, or &lt;em&gt;Hellzapoppin&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, or Jimmy Durante with that ah-cha-cha-cha routine of his, and countless other monuments besides that confirm what you already know — that if you are over forty or so you were substantially shaped in a world that can now only be accessed by means of archeology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that is the real message of the cold war; it was not the USSR that ceased to exist, but also the United States, replaced instead by a seeping vector of ideology that slowly permeated the rest of the world. It is not that postmodernism was inevitable, it is that it was spread through conscious effort. The American cultural hegemony allowed the infinite export of terms like “flexibility,” “governance,” “exclusion,” “multiculturalism,” and “minority”—these terms are an accurate description of of the United States, but are they applicable anywhere else? The inherent limitations imposed by foreknowledge of such ways of thinking are precisely those, as Chesterton says, that prevent the slave from ever freeing himself. Our modes of thinking are now predominantly &lt;em&gt;American&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; modes of thinking. People may claim to be Brazilian, or Chinese, or Liberian, but they are, unified by the medium of the internet, inherently &lt;em&gt;American&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—it is no longer the case that there are parts of the map where there may be dragons.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;westtexas&amp;#x2F;worldsfair.png&quot; &gt;

&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall the Western obsession with Japan, so ‘foreign’ in scope, yet populated by people whose problems resemble, more closely than anything, the same infertilities and violence of American cities. A notable advisory issued to western tourists is that the Japanese are xenophobic, and that foreigners feel out of place there. But this is what the world is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to be like—the country was designed for people whose ways of thinking were so incomprehensible that the only way to subdue them was to drop the bombs. The only part of the world was was supposed to be ‘welcoming’ to people of all kinds &lt;em&gt;was&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the United States.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tragedy of this cultural erosion, still perpetrated (more so than ever!) by the nebulous beast we refer to as ‘the internet’ is so vast so as to be truly baffling. The essential differences that made us what we were have now been entirely diffused. We are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; living in the United States. And like Americans, in the pretense of ‘celebrating’ our cultures we have reduced them to mere token representation à la food or tradition. We may yet know the ‘traditional’ way to prepare sushi—we may yet have textual renderings of the bushido—but we will never, ever get another samurai.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course—there are many who believe that the western ideologies perpetrated by the United States are ‘the best’ ones, and what I have described is not tragic. But to do so is to ignore the collective wisdoms and negate the experiences of our past generations, going against the very Christian notion of empathy; the lives of the trillions who came before meant something, dammit, they were people, just as you or I were, and they lived good lives and meaningful lives and beautiful lives, and they created wonderful things. They were more human than we ever were—we cyborgs of form and function, who in our quest for meaning have laid waste to the whole notion altogether.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This external manifestation of the ‘obsession’ with postmodernity has led to failed countries, declining populations, and a world which is therefore full of meaningless acts. In some sense the world we live in is now profoundly Nietzschean. But what I am interested in is the &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; analogue of this—we know what damages have been done to our collective psyches, but what about our individual ones?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, too, I am beaten to the punch by Mark Fisher, writing for &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in 2012:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental illness has been depoliticized, so that we blithely accept a situation in which depression is now the malady treated most by the NHS. The neoliberal policies implemented first by the Thatcher governments in the 1980s and continued by the New Labour and the current coalition have resulted in the privatization of of stress […] The NHS, like the education system and other public services, has been forced to try to deal with the social and psychic damage caused by the deliberate destruction of solidarity and security […] It would be facile to argue that every single case of depression can be attributed to economic or political causes; but it is equally facile to maintain—as the dominant approaches to depression do—that the roots of all depression must lie either in individual brain chemistry or in early childhood experiences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that proclivity to mental illness is an effective metric via which to measure individual brain chemistries—after all, it’s not that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is mentally ill. But the precise pathologies through which mental illness manifests is now globalized. But with individual brains being so highly subjective, what exactly is happening here?
Perhaps it is best to begin by making some bulleted observations and asking ourselves certain questions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way that mental illness manifests is standardized globally according to the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Heath Disorders, Vol. 5), and the training provided to mental health practitioners throughout the world is based on the DSM-5. Is it true that the DSM is an accurate description of mental illnesses &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;? The DSM was largely compiled for a western audience, and there is, in fact, no reason that it would be applicable to people who live in widely different societies.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As our societies converge to this postmodern ‘American’ ideal, the pathologies that people with mental illness demonstrate &lt;em&gt;converge&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to the pathologies described in the DSM. It is true that, for instance, Aboriginal people show the highest rates of depression in Australia. But is it necessarily true that what practitioners perceive as depression is indeed depression as described by the DSM-5? What we call a mental illness is a collection of symptoms, and each individual condition is highly localized. But if ‘depression’ is merely a western stamp applied to Aboriginal people with mental health conditions, are the remedies effective?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the knowledge of mental illness correspond to prevalence mental illness? How do we know that by spreading information about mental illness, we are not, in fact, achieving the opposite—that by making people aware of the pathologies associated with depression, we are, in fact, making it more likely for them to &lt;em&gt;act out&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; these pathologies?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;westtexas&amp;#x2F;dsm.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to these questions can be explained by studying the case of Anorexia Nervosa in Japan, where traditional doctors used to describe a phenomenon of food-avoidance termed &lt;em&gt;Fushoku-byo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in the 17th and 18th centuries which manifested as large proportions of young women abstaining from eating food leading to impaired physiological and psychosocial functioning. However—and this is the key point—none of these disorders were linked to &lt;em&gt;fatphobia or body image issues&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the Japanese, like all western countries, have increased prevalence of Anorexia among their young women. Anorexia, however, is almost certainly a body image issue, and it has been well-studied that it arises in societies where women are subjected to discrimination based on their body shape and those which have a prevalence of unhealthy body types in their media. So what is going on here?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer lies in the fact that while the pathologies demonstrated by &lt;em&gt;Fushoku-byo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and Anorexia are similar they are fundamentally different illnesses. There is no reason to suspect that &lt;em&gt;Fushoku-byo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; could be ‘fixed’ by Anorexia treatments. But why has &lt;em&gt;Fushoku-byo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; been &lt;em&gt;replaced&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Anorexia? As western ideas spread and the patients afflicted with &lt;em&gt;Fushoku-byo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; become &lt;em&gt;aware&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of Anorexia, it is completely possible that they develop the associated body-image issues as well, transforming the illness into something that it was not.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal reference frames through which people conceptualize of not only mental illnesses but &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is now so intrinsically linked to the western view of things that it has introduced pathologies into populations which previously did not have any. Now that everyone is a suburban American, everyone has the problems of a suburban American—disenchantment, lack of meaning, hatefulness. And these ‘problems’ are somehow expected to be solved through &lt;em&gt;individual self-reflection&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;! In the process of exporting American ideology to the world, they exported American illnesses as well. It is preposterous to think that societies which are decidedly not American would not have had ways of tackling the underlying ways that illnesses manifested in them—these are &lt;em&gt;societies&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and not (as our modernity affliction would like us to think) infantile. But these new illnesses, these new pathologies—with society having no methods to tackle them beyond the individual practitioner method of ignoring the social aspect of these illnesses entirely&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#foot&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;—run through the population and destroy both the people and the societies underlying them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am like the Lüneburger pig. My thinking is a passion. I am very good at rooting out truffles for others; I myself take no pleasure in them. I root out the problems with my snout, but all I can do with them is toss them back over my head.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;— &lt;em&gt;Either&#x2F;Or&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, Søren Kierkegaard&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then why are you, living on the sunny shores of California, &lt;em&gt;relating&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to Kierkegaard? Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky—these are authors that have been lauded as presenting the very core of the human condition, but was this the &lt;em&gt;human&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; condition when they wrote them in the frozen wastelands of northern Europe? What has happened is that the very societies that we have constructed have been those particularly conducive to resulting in the kinds of people that would understand and relate to Kierkegaard, that would understand and relate to Dostoevsky. Is this something we hope to achieve? Is this &lt;em&gt;good&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem here that I am suggesting an image that looks roughly like the following:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a ‘natural’ way that people living a particular lifestyle in a particular location behave.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The modern world, having been completely culturally colonized by the United States, forces upon them a ‘postmodern’ lifestyle and manner of thinking which has strange disparity with their ‘natural’ lifestyle.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This disparity leads to mental illness.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The modern world has ineffective remedies to treat this mental illness.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not entirely incorrect, but there is significant nuance here that is best expressed as this disjunction between ‘natural’ and ‘postmodern’ lifestyles in terms of the societies in which they arise. It is not that a postmodern lifestyle is some kind of big Other—it was indeed borne out of society in itself; Europeans first, then Americans. When Kafka wrote &lt;em&gt;The Trial&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, it was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a work isolated from its surroundings; it was the natural reflection of the Prague in which he lived, the same Prague which birthed a man so enormously alienated from the world around him that he fashioned himself a gross insectoid incapable of love or loving. That it was something later co-opted widely by the canon reveals that whatever impulses inherent in &lt;em&gt;The Trial&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; are more widespread, if anything—the fundamental truths that it reveals later &lt;em&gt;became&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; fundamental truths about human society.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;westtexas&amp;#x2F;trial.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is similar to that posed by Fisher about capitalism in &lt;em&gt;Capitalist Realism&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: why is our natural response to &lt;em&gt;The Trial&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that it reveals inherent truths about human society, and not that it is a mere reflection of the world we currently exist in? Is it not possible to imagine a world free from the bureaucratic nightmare of existence? Why can we not imagine a world that is somehow &lt;em&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Kafkaesque, a world in which Kafka is not darkly comedic, but rather alienates and is rejected, the denizens of which cannot even conceptualize the locked doors and illogical complexity portrayed in it? Should we not seek to live in such a world?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inherent problem here—and what is really the primary problem inherent in postmodern society, leading to an incessant lack of meaning that pervades not just human souls but the very fabric of society upon which they reside—is that the economy through which this world is governed is an &lt;em&gt;information&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; economy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-man-who-could-neither-walk-nor-talk&quot;&gt;the man who could neither walk nor talk&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-man-who-could-neither-walk-nor-talk&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-man-who-could-neither-walk-nor-talk&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I was at my grandmother’s place in North India, where we witnessed a strange apparition on the street in front of the house—two men walking side-by-side, one young and one old, the young man holding the old by the arms and whispering something in his ear, forcing him to walk. The older man did not seem to have any self-awareness whatsoever; he did not even do as he was told, and was merely being guided to an endpoint by the younger man. They walked for about half an hour, then once the ritual was complete, the old man was shaken back into a neighboring house.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked my grandmother the meaning of this strange behavior, and she gave me the following response: about three years ago, one day for no reason at all, the older man did not get up from his bed and completely refused to walk or talk. Since then he had never spoken a word nor walked without guidance—he would eat, however, without being prompted, and would occasionally make his way to the bathroom. He was viewed by doctor after doctor, each one of which could find no physiological abnormalities whatsoever—nor did MRI or CT scans reveal any impaired functioning to the brain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered what entry in the DSM-5 explained that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are strange creatures. They don’t make sense, nor have they ever made sense. The postmodern idyllic paragon of an American happiness is a narrow metric through which to judge people, but so are &lt;em&gt;most other ideals&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The circumstances through which they have existed throughout history have been so disparate that making any judgement at all about how it is possible to achieve a state beyond self-hatred and meaninglessness is something is impossible. But people have tried—for a long, long time, we had people like the Buddha, we had religion, and we had the church, all attempting, in some sense, to ward away that specter of apathy which pervades the human soul.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the Indian society in which my grandmother resides can lead to the man who is unable to walk or talk, the postmodern society in which many of us reside now can render men comatose and violent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;westtexas&amp;#x2F;bomb.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting how we view violence in the modern world—not different from how we think of the Bomb, a weapon to be stashed and applied as a threat but never to be actually used. In that sense, violence is an ultimate sin; and similar to the bomb, a spectacle so vast and brilliant that it formed the major attraction that led to the creation of the Las Vegas strip, the information economy demonizes violence until it becomes a matter of spectacle. Just as it demonizes those who &lt;em&gt;use&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; violence, it desensitizes the ‘rest’ from truly understanding its destructive power. Violence is only effectively scary when its threat is palpable; when it is simply something occurring on a computer screen, it is reduced to nothing. In essence, it strips violence of all meaning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joke here is that ‘violence’ can be replaced with any of the natural human impulses that make us what we are.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is the underlying ‘political’ issue that remains unaddressed—that the beast known as the internet&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ff&quot;&gt;4&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; strips the world of its meaning and reduces human activity to mere individualization. ‘The world owes you nothing’—but that is precisely what societies do! They owe you things! They are structural frameworks through which the things that you have been denied can be obtained by you! It is not a dog-eat-dog world—you are not alone, and the whole reason we invented things like churches and saunas and cities was so that you &lt;em&gt;would not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; be alone! This structural framework is what the information economy erodes, and when it arrives it arrives with a proclamation of &lt;em&gt;inevitability&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;! It introduces within you the very concepts that it seeks to cultivate—it bombards you with ways of thinking that turn you into Chesterton’s slave—and then presents the resultant illnesses that it induces as problems for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to solve, you and you alone. As things that you must ‘fix’.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;freeing-the-mind-at-gunpoint&quot;&gt;freeing the mind, at gunpoint&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#freeing-the-mind-at-gunpoint&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: freeing-the-mind-at-gunpoint&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever understanding was gained from the previous section presents an interesting Catch-22: part of the sell of the information economy is that it places the weight of freeing yourself from its arms on you, while ensuring full well that any of the tools it provides to help you free yourself necessarily ignore the societal component that is innately necessary to ensure success—for things and acts to have meaning they need attributes like ‘causes’, else whatever meaning imbibed into the act is inherently meaningless. But taking prescription medication does not result in the actions of people around you suddenly becoming possible to comprehend. It may alleviate your existential discomforts, your inability to move, to leave your room, to make a phone call, but there is no reason that these newfound abilities solve your fundamental problem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then how is it possible to free yourself from the information economy if this drive and desire to free yourself is &lt;em&gt;part&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of the information economy—indeed, perhaps the very aspect of it that makes it &lt;em&gt;most&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; difficult for you to free yourself? The answer arrives in the form of the lone rebel at Tiananmen Square and the nature of his defiance; from Žižek, again:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this very moment of transparent clarity (things are presented in their utmost nakedness: a lone man against the brute force of the State) is, for our Western gaze, sustained by a cobweb of ideological implications, embodying a series of oppositions: individual versus state; peaceful resistance versus state violence; man versus machine; the inner force of a tiny individual versus the impotence of the powerful machine […] these implications, against the background of which the shot exerts its full direct impact, these ‘meditations’ which sustain the shot’s immediate impact, are not present for a Chinese observers, since such a series of oppositions is inherent to the European ideological legacy. And the same ideological background also overdetermines, say, our perception of the horrifying images of tiny individuals jumping from the burning WTC tower to certain death.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;— &lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Desert of the Real&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, Slavoj Žižek&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an almost Gödelian paradox here—it is impossible to even determine what an act of defiance against the information economy might be from within the framework of of the information economy. It cannot even be conceptualized, and that is the precise paradox that keeps you within it!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;westtexas&amp;#x2F;ts.png&quot; &gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just as it is possible to understand the lone rebel at Tiananmen Square from a &lt;em&gt;western&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; perspective, it is necessarily true that there exist acts of defiance against the information economy which are comprehensible as such acts from &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; it. Here is a way through which a Chinese civilian could ‘understand’ why these images are powerful in the west: by immigrating permanently and spending a long span of years integrating himself into society to the point where the fundamental natures of his thought follow broadly western strokes, he can then view the images through a lens which expresses to him how astonishingly defiant this act looks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason the same would not be true of the information economy. By refusing to engage with it—by finding yourself outside it—after many years of redressal, such acts make sense. The mind is a malleable object, and can be retrained, as Gary Harkness and Anatole Bloomberg attempt, through simple and effective acts performed day after day after day for years on end until the misfiring neurons correct themselves into a new, comprehensive whole. Here, in terms of escaping the inherent meaninglessness of existence enforced by postmodernism, the answer is to  escape the economy entirely. In essence: &lt;em&gt;stop consuming information&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; entirely&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#newf&quot;&gt;5&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no ‘hidden secret’. There are no books you can read, no pieces of advice you can follow that will reveal to you the fix to postmodernist malaise. Just pick a thing—a simple, repetitive thing—and do it again and again and again until you are no longer the same person.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of his novel &lt;em&gt;Siddhartha&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, Hermann Hesse tries to push forward a treatise which is forms a dual to the classical teachings of the Buddha: that achieving a state of nirvana is not something that is exclusive to being an ascetic, but rather something that can be achieved through a variety of means.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protagonist—a young Brahman by the name of Siddhartha—finds himself in numerous circumstances that lead to unfulfilment, detachment and a gaping hole in his heart, despite doing everything the ‘right’ way: first practicing the arts of the Brahman until he is unusually prolific, then retreating to an ascetic lifestyle until he is a young man. None of these things help. Eventually he encounters the Buddha himself, upon which he is immediately convinced that there in fact &lt;em&gt;is&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a solution to his problem, and whatever the solution is has been discovered by the Buddha. But he remains unconvinced that it is possible that such a solution can be &lt;em&gt;taught&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which forms his divergence from the path of the Buddha’s followers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Siddhartha decides to retreat to the world of the living, that Hermann terms &lt;em&gt;Saṃsāra&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#samsara&quot;&gt;6&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specifics of how Siddhartha enables this are largely irrelevant, but the vaguest terms are not—what Siddhartha does is simply become a merchant and spend the better part of his youth concerned with making money and gambling. Despite the first twenty or so years of his life having been spent attempting to achieve enlightenment, Siddhartha is able to successfully succumb to hedonism; simply pretending to be a hedonist is enough to transform him into one. It is the old adage of faking it till you make it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is this: doing an activity transforms you into the kind of person who does that activity, which brings with it an intense psychological change. Thus, any change—even ineffective—that is an activity that divorces you from the information economy transforms you into the kind of person who is in defiance of it. It is prudent, therefore, to analyze what this cultural baggage is that brings with itself postmodern existence, devoid of meaning—and the answer, of course reaches as far back to 1944 as Adorno’s ‘culture industry’:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Films, radio and magazines make up a system which is uniform as a whole and in every part. Even the aesthetic activities of political opposites are one in their enthusiastic obedience to the rhythm of the iron system. The decorative industrial management buildings and exhibition centers in authoritarian countries are much the same as anywhere else. The huge gleaming towers that shoot up everywhere are outward signs of the ingenious planning of international concerns, toward which the unleashed entrepreneurial system (whose monuments are a mass of gloomy houses and business premises in grimy, spiritless cities) was already hastening. Even now the older houses just outside the concrete city centres look like slums, and the new bungalows on the outskirts are at one with the flimsy structures of world fairs in their praise of technical progress and their built-in demand to be discarded after a short while like empty food cans.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Television looks to be an absolute godsend for a human subspecies that loves to watch people but hates to be watched itself. For the television screen affords access only one-way. A psychic ball-check valve. We can see Them; They can’t see Us. We can relax, unobserved, as we ogle. I happen to believe this is why television also appeals so much to lonely people. To voluntary shut-ins. Every lonely human I know watches way more than the average U.S. six hours a day. The lonely, like the fictive, love one-way watching. For lonely people are usually lonely not because of hideous deformity or odor or obnoxiousness—in fact there exist today support- and social groups for persons with precisely these attributes. Lonely people tend, rather, to be lonely because they decline to bear the psychic costs of being around other humans. They are allergic to people. People affect them too strongly. Let’s call the average U.S. lonely person Joe Briefcase. Joe Briefcase fears and loathes the strain of the special self-consciousness which seems to afflict him only when other real human beings are around, staring, their human sense-antennae abristle. Joe B. fears how he might appear, come across, to watchers. He chooses to sit out the enormously stressful U.S. game of appearance poker.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But lonely people, at home, alone, still crave sights and scenes, company. Hence television. Joe can stare at Them on the screen; They remain blind to Joe. It’s almost like voyeurism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that not the internet—a medium to watch &lt;em&gt;other people&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; doing things? It is nothing but the next manifestation of the capitalist desire to transform its own decline into an object of entertainment, milking more production in the process—production of more of itself, fifth- and sixth-order simulacra, a death-knell to the viewer. There is some nebulous notion of participation, of creation, you can be your own TV show—you no longer even watch attractive people do attractive things, but rather the textual intimation that such a thing is happening is enough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Siddhartha&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, the protagonist’s great revelation is his conscious deference to the absolute oneness of all things, a conscious ‘tapping in’ to his &lt;em&gt;Ātman&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#atman&quot;&gt;7&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; (and that of a great river) that reveals to him the eternal truth of existence—that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; existence is meaningful, that there is no duality between life and death, truth and falsity, good and bad, and that things are eternally perfect in the way that they are; that the linearity of time is an illusion, and that all things exist simultaneously in all their forms. This great universal consciousness is like that of the human—no individual cell is aware that it exists, yet the cells combined form a creature with its own consciousness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This universal human consciousness is given a curious disembodied form via the explicit transmission network of the world wide web, and like all forms of ideological expansion, it both shapes itself into the form of the world and also transforms the world into a form of itself&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#tlon&quot;&gt;8&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the key observation is that while the internet is particularly effective at accomplishing this goal, there is no reason why subsequent lack of meaning induced by the information economy is something &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to the internet—it is the culture industry by itself that induces such a notion. Recalling the case of Japanese Anorexia, consider the following: for body image issues to arise, there must be a body and there must be an image. In a world without mirrors, such a disease could never exist! The abnormality of the mirror induces an image, which induces the issues; and indeed, it is not a coincidence that it was the same people who discovered mirrors that also gave rise to bodybuilding—the ancient Greeks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am saying is stupid and ridiculous. It is not really possible to exist without consuming media in the world today.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is no sense in which it is possible to ‘manage’ media consumption without being influenced by it, without being transformed into a slave of the information economy&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#net&quot;&gt;9&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;. And yet there may be slaves, but there still remain degrees to which this slavery takes place. Depending on the degrees to which you cut these things out of your life you reclaim more of your inherent state, though it may find existing in the modern world worrying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is always the same: visualize the kind of person you would like to become and start doing the actions this person does. Do them every day for 10 years, and you will become that person.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem as if there are more questions to be asked, more answers that are needed. The information economy leaves you always wanting more. But part of the problem is that this ‘more’ is never enough—there is nothing to be found beyond the most banal of aphorisms that form the collective folk wisdom of the same human consciousness that birthed the internet, but distilled to its essence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the predation that postmodern thought inflicts on your brain is hyperindividualization, destroying any concept of thinking of one as something other than merely the ‘I’, or the Freudian ego. Such is the case of Charles in Bresson’s &lt;em&gt;The Devil Probably&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, who resorts to suicide upon realization of the fact that he is a very product of the society which he finds sickening.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this fact is not a downer, but rather a liberation—ignore the strain of hyperindividualization, and forgive yourself. &lt;em&gt;It is not your fault that you turned out the way that you are&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It is not even your fault if you are &lt;em&gt;not able to be what you want to be&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Your personality, your way of existence are not crimes that you inflict upon the world. The forces which went into determining such a thing are far beyond anything you could cause. Your only fault is your unwillingness to realize your potential as the person you want to be—not even in the failure of the attempt, but merely in the lack of attempt! Forgive and embrace yourself; it is not guilt you should feel, but determination.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;YOU CAN’T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what you may be doing, there will be failures.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That there are failures is a natural consequence of life, and it must be accepted—if you fail, &lt;em&gt;you are not at fault&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I recall this quote from the &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; captain Jean-Luc Picard, speaking to Ensign Wesley Crusher upon his rejection from Starfleet Academy:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible, yes—but it is &lt;em&gt;not weakness&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It is &lt;em&gt;not your fault&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. All it means is to try it again, next time—and if there is no next time, live with no regrets, allowing the totality of the &lt;em&gt;Saṃsāra&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to make the decisions for you. Maybe you will never succeed. But ultimately, the brunt of failure is not something for you to bear, but for the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;ONE DAY AT A TIME&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You go to the gym and train a muscle to abject failure, and nothing happens. Sometimes you go to the gym and you lift less than what you lifted last week. And sometimes you get injured, and you get up, and you can’t do the exercise well, and have to skip the gym. But if you keep going, day in and day out, you will eventually build a worthy physique.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing different to curing your mental problems. Sometimes you will fail. Sometimes you will be worse than before. Some days are horrible, truly horrific, and you zone out entirely, relapsing into the same behaviors that you tried so hard to rid yourself of. But, ultimately, if you try day in and day out, you will still build a worthy mind that is resistant to what the modern world can inflict upon you. You don’t need to think. You don’t need to doubt. You don’t need to blame yourself. Just &lt;em&gt;do the damn thing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. And even if it doesn’t work out, you will still be somewhere where you can be proud of yourself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be bad days. You cannot solve generations’ worth of illness in a day. But take each day as it is, and do what is to be needed—try to be better than yesterday, if you can—and after a year you will find that some days, at least, are not so bad. As you free yourself of the chokehold that modern existence has on you, you will find moments of clarity that teach you more than lessons—even the Buddha’s—ever could.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;THE TOUGH GET GOING&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quote hung by Gary Harkness’s father on the wall of his childhood room, a quote it took him years and years to internalize.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that things will go wrong is an &lt;em&gt;inevitability&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. But you cannot control inevitabilities—all you can control is how you face them. It seems, like everything else, to be a banality. But there is a fundamental truth to this sentence. You are given the ability to control how you react to failure, how you react to the world and to your own mind. It has been gifted to you. It is part of your very life itself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is this very ability to control how you react to things that gives you the ability to&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;NEVER GIVE UP&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no matter what happens when the time comes. And at the end of it—not knowing all the things that have come before and all the things that will come after—the following will, always, &lt;em&gt;always&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; be true.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find, very often, that I am lambasted with accusations of being an Americophile. Although I will always have the sullen defense that I partially grew up around those parts, it is not really a description I would call inaccurate. I am, fortunately or unfortunately, completely obsessed with the United States and its history and culture. Less so with the current era of the country, being what it is, but in that regard I am in some sense beat—like it or not, we all live in the United States today, no matter where our geolocation lies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this is not to suggest that modern psychiatric techniques are ineffective at treating the underlying illnesses, it is to suggest that they have problems in terms of &lt;em&gt;preventing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; them. It is well-known that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, for instance, have very successfully been treated with drugs such as lithium and extensive amounts of talk therapy. But despite repeated attempts, psychiatry is no closer to preventing people from developing depression, for instance (which is at record highs) or treating BPD, which is an illness that is well-known to be significantly exacerbated in the absence of stabilizing social relationships and in the presence of the internet; the kicker here being that psychiatry is surprisingly good at being a &lt;em&gt;medical&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; treatment, but is an ineffective solution to fixing people&#x27;s lives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to be said about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the internet has become so ubiquitous and how the fact that the world pushes it onto you is not some kind of organic process that is the be-end of history, similar to how people constantly push this narrative of ‘technological progress is inevitable’—no it isn’t, the Romans were extraordinarily technologically advanced from about 200BC - 400AD, before this advancement was undone in Europe for the better part of a millennium. Just because we &lt;em&gt;currently&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; reside in the most technologically advanced age in history does not mean that this has always been the case; for a lot of history it just legitimately wasn’t. Always remember—the Bombs may yet fly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are people online who shill these digital detoxes, or whatever, which they headline with fancy titles such as &lt;em&gt;I Stopped Using My Phone for 30 Days: This is What Happened&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. These people are the equivalent of a well-meaning American liberal reading a book about Islam as if it would help him understand the rationale behind 9&#x2F;11. Obviously, such things do not work, and only lead to trite observations. Bragging about how you have a greater attention span to read books means precisely nothing at all. For the &lt;em&gt;true&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; escapee, opening a cell phone and attempting to view a series of short-form videos is basically incomprehensible; it resembles your aged grandparents squinting at a cell phone and greeting the observation that people spend their whole lives on it with a loud “&lt;em&gt;This&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is what people are addicted to?”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is somewhat different from the actual concept of संसार in Vedic literature, which simply refers to the totality of the cyclical world of birth, death and rebirth. The specifics of Hermann’s usage correspond more with the ‘material’ world, in the manner of Madonna’s &lt;em&gt;Material Girl&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—the world in which people are concerned with things such as wealth or sex, or worldly pleasures.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contact and the habit of Tlön have disintegrated this world. Enchanted by its rigor, humanity forgets over and again that it is a rigor of chess masters, not of angels. Already the schools have been invaded by the (conjectural) “primitive language” of Tlön; already the teaching of its harmonious history (filled with moving episodes) has wiped out the one which governed in my childhood; already a fictitious past occupies in our memories the place of another, a past of which we know nothing with certainty—not even a that it is false. Numismatology, pharmacology and archeology have been reformed. I understand that biology and mathematics also await their avatars... A scattered dynasty of solitary men has changed the face of the world. Their task continues. If our forecasts are not in error, a hundred years from now someone will discover the hundred volumes of the Second Encyclopedia of Tlön.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then English and French and mere Spanish will disappear from the globe. The world will be Tlön. I pay no attention to all this and go on revising, in the still days at the Adrogue hotel, an uncertain Quevedian translation (which I do not intend to publish) of Browne’s Urn Burial.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  
  &lt;div class=&quot;from&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;— &lt;em&gt;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, Jorge Luis Borges&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
Is this not what the internet does? What television does? Fictional worlds that exist only to entertain, but imprint themselves upon the collective human psyche until the psyche inverts the real world into the fictional. I have said that we all already live in the ‘fictional’ United States that Kissinger exported, but, like a self-fulfilling prophecy, in the very same sense the world that we live increasingly becomes the fictional world on the internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;net&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;9&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an irony here in that I am writing these very words on the internet, and that I am the kind of person who has things like ‘fan of literature’ and ‘fan of cinema’ in his bio. But it is an old bit that the people most opposed to drinking alcohol are former alcoholics. You need to be someone addicted to something to realize just how horrific addiction is. There is no one more qualified to speak about how horrific the culture industry is than someone addicted to it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this passive habit of participating in dream interpretation, which usually manifests in the form of me waking up in a cold sweat, typing up whatever it was that disturbed me on the notes app on my phone, and forwarding it to a few well-chosen friends who provide feedback based on the severity of what I saw—pell-mell ignoring me if it’s merely a Lovecraftian nightmare, or delving into deeper analysis if it involves real people (them, often, but also a mess of recurring actors in my life—parents, ex-girlfriends, Tom Brady, the usual). I would be inclined to keep a complete dream diary if not for the fact that such a thing is almost completely useless if tampered with and I don’t really think I possess the fortitude to transcribe out every single one of them, especially the truly embarrassing ones which horrify you upon waking up and force you into a nebulous stupor of attempting to ward away your ‘intrusive thoughts,’ or whatever. One of my close friends supposedly had one for over a year! I think they’re hidden away in a box, in a place no one (including him, most of the time) has access to. His conclusion is that each individual dream is surprisingly easy to interpret in isolation, but forms a stronger matted net of the various disturbances in your life when seen as part of the greater picture; the meanings are not usually anything unexpected, but it’s shocking to see them so bluntly laid out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I would like to partake in genuine Jungian psychoanalysis or at the very least dabble in applying the &lt;em&gt;I Ching&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;, actually noting them down has given me the humbling experience of determining that I am not a particularly complex person in the essentials—it’s mostly just my gaping flaws and various kinds of insecurities unceremoniously lobbed at me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, however, I get a very entertaining dream. My favorite so far has been a (pretty much) 1:1 recreation of &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; from the point of view of the camera—which means that I basically played close to the entirety of the movie back in my head as if I were watching it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;marcieblane&amp;#x2F;matrix.png&quot;  alt=&quot;the matrix&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘interpretation’ here is of course largely just that I really like &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but that’s also a distinctly abnormal way in which a movie manifested as a dream. It is far more usual for movie tropes to slip into the particulars of my daily life. The most recent iteration of this, and the one that prompted me to write down this post, was a dream in which I was neatly slotted in the place of Justin Theroux’s character Adam Kesher in &lt;em&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, with the rest of the cast being played by a variety of people I knew in real life. The actual plot proceeded through a mixture of Theroux’s storyline and Naomi Watts’ ‘dream’ storyline that comprises the bulk of the first half both being enacted by me (although I was statically Theroux’s character, just going through a more complicated arc). In retrospect there was some unintentional hilarity—I have a friend who is a recurring minor character in my dreams, and in this one he was present largely to get jump-scared by a trash monster—but most of it was very unnerving and disturbing. The climactic moment of this dream was a recreation of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;h2XnBsLP9lE?feature=shared&quot;&gt;‘This is the Girl’ sequence&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in which Theroux, the director of a movie being made in the film, is forced to cast an actress he doesn’t want to due to forces beyond his will despite knowing that Naomi Watts is definitely the best choice for the role… and he looks back and their eyes meet, there’s an uncertain exchange of emotions, and then she leaves&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to me was that the sequence kept repeating and rebooting itself in my head with different people playing Naomi Watts’ character and the lyrics of the song sung by Camilla Rhodes becoming increasingly sinister each time to the point where it became terrifying and I was forced awake.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;marcieblane&amp;#x2F;adam.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;adam kesher&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I don’t think it takes a genius to interpret what this particular dream was about, but I’m going to put this on hiatus for now this because it makes me uncomfortable to perform a public dissemination of my innermost thoughts. Once I woke and performed the whole ritualized transcription, I navigated to the video above to listen to the actual song played in the movie, which turned out to be Linda Scott’s &lt;em&gt;I’ve Told Every Little Star&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (1961).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, baby, I&#x27;ve told every little star&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just how sweet I think you are&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why haven&#x27;t I told you?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you may love me, too&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, my darling, if you do&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why haven&#x27;t you told me?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a great song! A little bit of research suggests that it was part of the original wave of ‘teen idols’ in the ‘50s and the ‘60s, which was probably the first truly organized pop culture phenomenon designed to appeal to teenagers as an independent social class in themselves. What stands out to me, of course, is the stark directness of the lyrics—there’s really no pussyfooting around, no attempt to cater to any kind of sensibility; it’s just a bare-bones pop song about being in love with someone. Naturally, listening to this led me to go down a long rabbit hole of late ‘50s and early ‘60s pop music. We’ve all heard the jazz, but because of its improvisational nature even jazz ‘sellouts’ like swing still carried with them the underlying sensibilities of New Orleans—like, I think there’s a meaningful sense in which you cannot really call &lt;em&gt;any&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Ella Fitzgerald song just pure product in the vein of Linda Scott’s recording above. Maybe Sinatra’s early stuff?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, allowing Apple Music to cycle through related songs&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; led me to this gem, which charted in 1962:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody likes me&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m everybody&#x27;s friend&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say, &quot;You&#x27;re great girl—&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On whom we can depend&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this should make me happy&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But every night I cry&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&#x27;m such a great girl&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can&#x27;t I get a guy?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teachers say I&#x27;m clever&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smartest girl in school&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to things like boys&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I&#x27;m just a fool&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish that I were different&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish that I could be&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all my silly girlfriends&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who have more fun than me&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Marcie Blane’s &lt;em&gt;Why Can’t I Get a Guy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, ostensibly marketed towards high-school girls. Because I’m a dumb idiot easily swayed into sentimentalism, however, my reaction to this is some flavor of “the world is so unfair, why can’t she get a guy, I hate everything, [grumble].” Contributing to this, of course, is how Marcie &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—there’s a genuine longing in her chorus borne out of frustration, which would make sense, since it would indeed appear that she was 18 at the time this was written.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I think this is genius.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bare-bones teenage sentimentalism can’t really be found in, like, Ella Fitzgerald, or something, as I previously mentioned, being more &lt;em&gt;complex&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; works of art—the emotions she deals with are somehow deeper, more matured, which would make sense since her target audience is more mature, less prone to hysteria. But this is also the kind of teenage sentimentalism that can’t really be found in &lt;em&gt;today’s&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; teen music. Songs for teenagers today are more complex in terms of how they conduct themselves lyrically. Take Taylor Swift’s &lt;em&gt;You Belong With Me&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which is about something similar to Marcie Blane’s song:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&#x27;s Cheer Captain, and I&#x27;m on the bleachers&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That what you&#x27;re looking for has been here the whole time&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My definition of simple here is a bit nuanced—I don’t mean that they are communicating a more hard-to-get sentiment, although that must also necessarily be true. What I mean is that the mental framework required to understand what Swift’s song is about requires you to have knowledge of a greater number of things. For example, “she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts” is setting up a contrast; you need to be able to ‘know’ what these things represent, and why T-shirts are a sign of being lame. There is a very significant amount being communicated here! The guy of Taylor’s fancy is interested in a different kind of girl, one that Taylor has to ‘compete’ with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also true in Marcy’s song, but the framework through which she describes the ‘silly girlfriends’ she wishes she were like is a lot simpler; they just have boyfriends and therefore have more fun than her. The key attribute of difference here is just some amount of idle-mindedness and ability to procure a guy. Meanwhile the framework through which Taylor thinks of her competition has numerous other attributes rather than just being the person her ‘guy’ is interested in. There is more material here to work with. She’s also cheer captain, Taylor is also on the bleachers, dividing the two socially according to high school cliques.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;marcieblane&amp;#x2F;marcie.png&quot;  alt=&quot;marcie blane&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really interesting to me because the cliques of &lt;em&gt;You Belong with Me&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; are also how Taylor’s audience perceives themselves—it must be, otherwise the song wouldn’t make sense. Would Taylor’s song work if introduced to the ‘60s audience? It’s a good question, and my answer is I honestly don’t know. The social constructs that are present in &lt;em&gt;You Belong With Me&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; were also present in the ‘60s, but it’s impossible to say if they were perceived in that manner. But I think the broader question is probably more potent—suppose that there was a song like &lt;em&gt;You Belong With Me&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which dealt with the same themes, just updated for the ‘60s audience so that there was no disjunction between the cliques as they existed and how they were perceived. Would the ‘60s audience ‘get’ the song?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer is &lt;em&gt;maybe not even then&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Just because the audience would be able to recognize the cliques doesn’t mean that the manner in which Taylor is asking them to relate to the contrast would hit in the same way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really interesting question, one which I’ve generally become more interested in as of recent. Maybe a broader perspective could help in phrasing it correctly.
I’ve found myself pondering this increasingly as of late. Maybe a broader perspective could help in phrasing it correctly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, it is interesting that I am interpreting a dream &lt;em&gt;about&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which is itself (famously) a movie that takes place in a dream—indeed, most interpretations of the scene I talked about conclude that the scene is taking place within a dream in the context of the movie itself. So I was dreaming the dream from &lt;em&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but my own interpretation is different from how the dream should be interpreted in the movie. In the movie the dreamer is Naomi Watts, but in the context of my own dream the dreamer is Theroux (which is the character I am projected onto).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnote-definition&quot; id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-definition-label&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to pre-1960s music is something I do with some frequency, but it is always an &lt;strong&gt;event&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;—post-‘60s music is just what I listen to on the daily, so it can’t really be counted as such. But whenever I fall into these spans of listening to old pop a fun exercise is always to listen to something quite mild like The Beatles’ &lt;em&gt;I Want to Hold Your Hand&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; or The Kinks’ &lt;em&gt;You Really Got Me&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; immediately after—with that pre-‘60s context in mind, these songs sound insane. Maybe the only legitimate descriptor is that they sound like, well, as if the devil somehow made his way into your stereo.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Until recently I had never watched a Jonathan Demme movie. A sort of shocking confession on my part—I do know generally everything about &lt;em&gt;The Silence of the Lambs&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and I’m sure I caught it on HBO as a teenager, but that was so long ago that I might as well have not watched it. And though I’ve watched the clips and seen Tina Weymouth do &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;cuJl5TJzvOI?feature=shared&quot;&gt;that weird monkey shuffle thing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on stage I’ve never watched &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;and-you-may-ask-yourself-how-did-i-get-here&quot;&gt;and you may ask yourself: “how did i get here?”&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#and-you-may-ask-yourself-how-did-i-get-here&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: and-you-may-ask-yourself-how-did-i-get-here&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did watch that took away my Demme-unfamiliarity (and inspired me to write this blog post) was 2008’s &lt;em&gt;Rachel Getting Married&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;goodkid&amp;#x2F;rgm.png&quot;  alt=&quot;rachel getting married&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Rachel Getting Married (2008)&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have tried very hard to ascertain what particular manner of movies appeal to me. Finding the answer always seems to be a losing proposition. For a while there I thought that I generally disliked slow cinema, but Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s &lt;em&gt;Millennium Mambo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and Tsai Ming-liang’s &lt;em&gt;Goodbye, Dragon Inn&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; proved me wrong—the latter, in fact, is basically just a collection of near-still images set to music and the sound of King Hu’s &lt;em&gt;Dragon Inn&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; playing in the background. The difference between these and the more European style of slow cinema which I have a general distaste for is perhaps the actual images appearing on screen. It is not necessarily true that a slow pace is what puts of me off, but rather slow slogs through grimness à la Theo Angelopoulos, which is really what characterizes all the neorealisms that European cinema seems to have latched onto; Godard has his 8-minute tracking shot in &lt;em&gt;Weekend&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, sure, but that fascinates me beginning to end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is not true that simply images that I like comprise a good movie or else I would be a fanatic for Bertolucci’s &lt;em&gt;The Dreamers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which I nevertheless find poor in both conception and execution. I guess what I’m really looking for is this manner of psychological complexity which can only really be expressed as strongly expressing the interiority of the characters through their actions—and in the case of cinema the scene (but I don’t mean the mise en scène—this always strikes me as kitschy). It is always important that the actions of characters not be &lt;em&gt;explicable&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but correct, even so.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is easier to explain what I don’t mean. There is a sharp tendency in modern storytelling to think of characters as bundles of attributes—as if their personalities can be neatly sorted into likes&#x2F;dislikes, experiences, pivotal moments, relationships… you get the gist. ‘Modern storytelling’ is probably an erroneous term, but there exist at least a vast amount of resources available on the internet geared towards this mechanization of writing which spends a lot of time on things like ‘consistency’ or ‘believability.’ It is kind of like applying the three-act structure to how characters progress in the narrative. There is already a fallacy here insofar as it already simplifies the conception of the character to something that can be managed through something resembling excel sheets, rendering them generally inhuman. The potent example here is anime, because it is quite explicit in terms of power scaling, but it is also more generally applicable to something like the film &lt;em&gt;Anora&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, in which the titular character’s ‘arc’ is so explicable as to be rendered moot—I can pretty much describe the psychology of Anora’s ending in plain English. This is essentially the most damning criticism I can give of a film—that the film does not even use its visual language to construct an experience which is inseparable from the cinematic form, and is in fact replicable just by a verbal description.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of something like &lt;em&gt;Anora&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, the usual argument goes that this psychology renders the character believable. And it is true that real people do sometimes follow the kind of arcs closely associated with movie characters—movies are quite good at portraying addicts, for instance, and though the films they star in have an unfortunate tendency to be banal and repetitive, I am not going to argue that they get the fundamental psychology wrong. Because the external psychology of a recovering addict sort of &lt;em&gt;does&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; loosely correspond to this three-act pattern of recognition → failure → recovery.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;goodkid&amp;#x2F;trainspotting.png&quot;  alt=&quot;trainspotting&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have to interject here with two observations:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is not the job of a movie to portray ‘believable’ characters, and there is no rule that states that characters have to be believable or accurate to be good or entertaining, or even that believable characters are any kind of component of a good film.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While such structures may correspond to accurate external, observable psychologies, cinema as a medium has developed a vast amount of techniques to express the characters’ &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; psychologies, which often (or even usually) do not correspond to any such easily definable or expressible patterns.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of writing I describe above is something I don’t appreciate or enjoy, but it has its appeal. Where it falls completely flat for me, however, is when it is applied to characters dealing with or overcoming their ‘trauma’ (a loaded word, and not one I like to use—I am generally opposed to psychotherapy verbiage). It is really astonishing how poor films are at handling this particular aspect of humanity. The techniques seem to be quite stale: now I am by and large a big defender of &lt;em&gt;Good Will Hunting&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but the “It’s not your fault” sequence (although I love it in the context of that film) has caused irreparable damage to how movies approach cathartic moments of recognition, and the alternative just seems to be delving into Bergman’s worst proclivities and simply smearing walls with red or something as ‘symbolic’ representations of trauma (pretty much Ari Aster’s entire career). Neither of these are good. The latter looks flashy but has no substance. The former does not lend itself well to serious dramas.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The misconception here is that the language of cinema is not a language &lt;em&gt;of metaphor&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Cinema does not need to allude, because it can simply show—the need for allusion is caused by inherent limitations of the form. Then allusions through the mise en scène—which I described previously as kitschy—can be ‘symbolic,’ sure, but don’t really serve a purpose when you sacrifice actual psychological complexity in the characters in favor &lt;em&gt;of&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the symbol. I’ve mentioned that this is a habit of Bergman’s, but it’s also an unfortunate one of Kieślowski’s in &lt;em&gt;Blue&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which by using the color as a symbol of Julie’s grief outsources recovery away from the character and leaves her kind of flat. In &lt;em&gt;Red&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, on the other hand, I don’t think the color really means anything, and therefore whatever is left is a complex interplay between the actors and the people they are portraying and the film becomes very compelling indeed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so then what is a film that actually does well with the psychologies of the people involved? My go-to answer is Guadignino, who has made a whole career out of this sort of stuff, but does it pretty entertainingly in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;E0BwwSXFy2M?feature=shared&quot;&gt;this clip&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Challengers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;goodkid&amp;#x2F;ews.png&quot;  alt=&quot;eyes wide shut&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;em&gt;Challengers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; because at no point during the runtime of the film is it clear what the priorities of each of the characters are or what they want from each other or really even what they want in general, but every decision the characters make, nevertheless, is perfectly in character—Guadignino manages to communicate the personalities of the characters without making them even the remotest bit explicable, and it is really quite unclear what they are going to do next or why they are going to do it. This is one way to make something psychologically rich. A method that is more naturally ingrained in the concept of a &lt;em&gt;scene&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dsvLJbghXjk?feature=shared&quot;&gt;this sequence&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from Kubrick’s &lt;em&gt;Eyes Wide Shut&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, in which Tom Cruise (wandering the streets of New York City lonely and disturbed after a heated discussion with his wife who recounts her adulterous thoughts) encounters a manifestation of his deepest desire at that moment: a woman willing the spend the night with him. The subtleties here are so rich that the last time I watched this film, my friend paused the DVD midway and exclaimed “this is completely insane!”—referring, of course, to the sheer ingenuity and the hundreds of thousands of moving parts here that comprise a really bizarre encounter that’s impossible to look away from.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;and-you-may-tell-yourself-this-is-not-my-beautiful-house&quot;&gt;and you may tell yourself: “this is not my beautiful house”&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#and-you-may-tell-yourself-this-is-not-my-beautiful-house&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: and-you-may-tell-yourself-this-is-not-my-beautiful-house&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all the 1500 or so movies that I have gone through in my lifetime, there is no film which achieves a blend of all these types of ways to maintain psychological richness while having the clear intent to explore a character that has suffered through grave amounts of trauma better than &lt;em&gt;Rachel Getting Married&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It may very well be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;goodkid&amp;#x2F;kym2.png&quot;  alt=&quot;rachel getting married&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To briefly recapitulate, Kym Buchman is a recovering drug addict returning to her childhood home for a weekend in the hopes of celebrating her sister Rachel’s wedding. Rachel is much better off than Kym—she is finishing a doctorate—but the nature of their relationship is unclear; it seems as if they were very close in childhood, but Kym’s history of self-destructive behavior has caused a rift in their relationship. She is also dearly loved by her father, who is helping organize the wedding, but is mortified by how she is being patronized by him. It’s unclear how much Kym has ‘recovered’ or whether such a recovery is even possible and if so what it would entail. Over the course of the weekend, a variety of hard-to-watch events occur as Kym tries to reintegrate into a family that really does want her back.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot happening here, which is a good thing. Kym’s struggles are complex and multifaceted, and a simple treatment would not suffice. I mentioned earlier that the history of cinema has developed a variety of methods to capture the internal psychology of characters; the one Demme employs here is his handheld digital, reminiscent of the claustrophobic cameras of something like &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which also notoriously uses them to provide a POV of similarly ‘embarrassing’ moments—except in &lt;em&gt;Rachel Getting Married&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the embarrassment is &lt;em&gt;sincere&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and almost dreadfully unfunny.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really gets me here is that it is so, so clear that Kym is &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Before we get to know her we think she’s a bit of an entitled brat who doesn’t understand the consequences of being a narcotics addict and wants to leave rehab and shove it off as if it’s nothing. But even people who know and understand that they are addicts want to leave rehab. When we see her go to a narcotics anonymous meeting it seems as if she doesn’t really want to be there, and it’s true—she doesn’t want to be there, but she only doesn’t want to be there as in she wants to be the kind of person who doesn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to go to NA meetings to survive. Even before she goes to the NA meetings the scene is so palpable so as to be nauseous. It is so clear that her Dad loves her but worries for her and is trying to pretend as if he doesn’t, which is what Dads do. It is so clear that her sister loves her but can’t shake off the years and years of resentment she has gotten from being unable to deal with Kym’s nature. To someone like Kym this is the kind of dreadful atmosphere that exists in an exact opposition to the affirmation she needs to live. None of these people ‘make sense’—it is impossible to capture what is going on in their heads in a sequence of words because their feelings exist only as fleeting bundles drawing them to actions inside their mind. But the expressions of these feelings are genuine and tenuous.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;goodkid&amp;#x2F;kym.png&quot;  alt=&quot;rachel getting married&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the reason why I am so concerned with the behavior of her family the sheer moment Kym arrives home from rehab is because there is this disjunction between what her family think is the correct thing to do and what is the thing that they have been told to do. Ideally they would tell Kym to put on something nice, or get a nice haircut, or something, if she wasn’t in the state that she was in. But because they don’t have any understanding of what she is ‘going through’ they also don’t understand that Kym’s problem isn’t that she wants to be allowed to do whatever she wants because any restrictions that would be placed on her would act as triggers, it’s the precise opposite—she wants to be treated as she usually would because the ‘trigger’ is the acknowledgment that something is off. In her case her reaction is annoyance, then guilt, but really something more than just that and more of a mix of both combined with heightened stress and a deep love for them for even trying. The actual state of her brain is one that appeals immediately to your heart; it is so easy to empathize with, but nearly impossible to capture verbally with any kind of accuracy. Like, it’s her sister’s wedding. She wants to be happy and enjoy it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned scene—the one in which Kym goes to NA—arrives sufficiently early on to ensure that we learn that the thing that is driving Kym insane—the thing that has caused her to recover to whatever extent that she has—is the fact that she was responsible for the death of her younger brother during a car accident in which she was driving under the influence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;svg&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I struggle with God so much, because I can’t forgive myself. And I don’t really want to right now. I can live with it, but I can’t forgive myself. And sometimes I don’t want to believe in a God that could forgive me. But I do want to be sober. I’m alive and I’m present and there’s nothing controlling me. If I hurt someone, I hurt someone. I can apologize, and they can forgive me... or not. But I can change.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is Kym in 2008, ten years in and out of rehab, struggling, and it’s so hard to tell whether there is any understanding or recovery or what is even going on in that head of hers. But we know that she’s trying, that this is not a joke to her.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of other stuff that happens in this movie and there’s a lot of places where it hits, some even harder than this one. But the common thread as you go on is that despite the fact that she is trying it is still really hard to give Kym the kind of forgiveness that she wants or that she deserves. It is hard because it is true that she is not, like, a ‘normal person.’ She doesn’t behave the way that she should and it is understandable that she doesn’t behave the way that she should but it is also frustrating that she doesn’t behave the way that she should. She does awful things and can’t control her emotions and drives a car into a tree. What emotions are these? Unclear, but all we know is that they are overwhelming and negative.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;goodkid&amp;#x2F;rachel.png&quot;  alt=&quot;rachel getting married&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the scenes in this movie the one that I find perhaps the easiest to psychologically articulate is close to the end where she doesn&#x27;t stick around for the rest of the party and leaves. Just walks away. The dismal sense of abandonment is so large that Kym is literally unable to even exist around happiness until it feeds on and drains her life force out of her. There is no faith, good or bad, in which she could participate in something like this. It’s not that she doesn’t have the inclination or that she believes that she doesn’t deserve it. It’s that she doesn’t have the capacity. That this is impossible for her is a fact as simple and true as the sun rising from the east. She was not designed to exist around such things. It is not possible to exist around your family when they are presenting to you an infinitude of love while you have been trying for so long to get them to hate you. And yet she wants to feel some semblance of affection because this lack of it is somehow even worse. So she lights a stupid lantern as if it has meaning when it doesn’t. When you are hurting so badly in every single atom of your body it is not possible to exist reasonably around your beautiful sister who you love and who is getting married as she decides not to seat you on the family table because she doesn’t want you to make a scene when you know you are not capable of that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a fact of nature that people will be mean and that people will be cruel. But it is not easy to understand the kind of damage cruelty inflicts upon people. People &lt;em&gt;are&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; cruel to Kym. It is not easy for her and it is not easy for them. But it inflicts upon her an ardent desire to be home and to never be forgiven. To someone who already inflicts so much cruelty upon themselves it is even worse to find your loved ones agreeing with it, too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the wedding happens, and it goes well, and in the very end (because this is not a cruel movie, and it is a movie that carries with it empathy for all the people within it and for all the people in the audience watching it, too) the sisters embrace and Rachel shows genuine love and affection to Kym because she is, after all, her sister, and they were close and despite all that happened they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; close. And that gesture is not enough to cure Kym because no gesture will ever be enough, but it is something. And they are happy, if only for a brief moment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the summer I tried very hard to get into Kedrick Lamar’s 2012 album &lt;em&gt;good kid,  m.A.A.d city&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (which I’m going to call &lt;em&gt;GKMC&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;goodkid&amp;#x2F;gkmc.png&quot;  alt=&quot;good kid, m.A.A.d city&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;good kid, m.A.A.d city (2012)&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GKMC&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is quite universally beloved, so I was surprised to find that I originally found it alienating. I guess I did not really understand what I was supposed to be looking for here. I knew it was a concept album, but none of the beats seemed catchy to me, nor did it seem to make a lot of sense—in fact, it struck me as rather cliched renderings of Kendrick’s lived experiences in Compton, which had been one of the primary focuses of hip-hop music for multiple generations at that point. My personal opinion was that pretty much everything that could be said about this topic had already been said by Nas’s &lt;em&gt;Illmatic&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (although that takes place in Queens, not Compton). This was also exacerbated by the fact that the brand of hip-hop I was enjoying at the time was quite divorced from (the horrifically misnamed—I find it almost impossible to type this out without cringing) socially conscious rap, being mostly trap music.  I mean, I was almost exclusively bumping summer staples in the vein of Kanye and Travis Scott, so it would make sense that &lt;em&gt;GKMC&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; didn’t really register.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days after watching &lt;em&gt;Rachel Getting Married&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; I decided to give &lt;em&gt;good kid, m.A.A.d city&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; another go, with the nagging suspicion that I would ‘get it’, this time. And after all that it seems to me that listening to &lt;em&gt;GKMC&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as if it were a chronicle of the state of inner-city racial politics in America was foolhardy and reductive, although it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; obviously that as well. After listening to it in full and listening to it again and again and again my only remaining thoughts were that this is an album &lt;em&gt;for&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Kym.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose there is a trivial sense in which this sounds foolish. These two people are nothing alike.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But insofar as there is a ‘point’ to &lt;em&gt;GKMC&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; it is one that can be unveiled by stripping the album back to its barest essence, kind of like how Radiohead’s &lt;em&gt;OK Computer&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is only revealed once you get rid of the flashy guitar solos and synchronize with the album’s droning utterances about the sheer mental and physical exhaustions inherent to living in a modern society. And if you strip back &lt;em&gt;GKMC&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; you reveal a person who is profoundly scared and is engulfed in forces that they cannot understand and maybe even do not want to understand. What is common between Kym and Kendrick isn’t the kind of people they are but the kind of natures they share. Both of these people have a profound self-hatred for actions &lt;em&gt;they&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; committed but due to reasons that do not have anything to do with them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The horror inherent in &lt;em&gt;GKMC&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; isn’t in the nature of the acts Kendrick describes himself committing or the lifestyles that he describes himself living but in the sheer inevitability of it. It’s in the fact that he was always going to turn out this way—that there does not exist a possible reality in which is not somehow assimilated into the gang culture he was raised in. And Kendrick obviously hates himself for it, but that begs the question—is it worth hating himself? How does he both own up and take the full brunt of responsibility for his own actions when his actions were merely expressions of a culture he did not choose to be born in and he had no say in doing? And it is this same culture which has both given him the ability to express himself on the record you are listening to while also instilling in him a blanket desire to ‘escape’ via the pursuit of money and power. And these are his primary preoccupations, sure, but is there a meaningful separation between the things that he as an individual wants and the desires that were inculcated in him by the nature of his growing up? Both these people struggle profoundly with God, and they do not know what it even means to seek forgiveness for an action that you were only partially responsible for. Does someone choose to be an addict?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;goodkid&amp;#x2F;compton.png&quot;  alt=&quot;compton&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all good questions with no answers. But I guess that the answer to the ultimate question posed by both of these people—is it possible to take responsibility for an act you were only partially responsible for, and had no meaningful say in preventing—is it possible to forgive yourself for the way that you are and continue to be, when you had no say in &lt;em&gt;becoming&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that person—is that holding contradictory beliefs in your head isn’t really a fallacy to be ironed out but rather the default state in which human beings exist. Of course it is possible. And the ways that which human beings in this state express themselves goes beyond words. It is not &lt;em&gt;explicable&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. And people are complex, and they can be cruel, but sometimes they really do mean well, and sometimes that is very hard to see.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer of &lt;em&gt;Rachel Getting Married&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is Jenny Lumet, daughter of Sydney Lumet, and as far as I can tell this was the only feature-length screenplay that she wrote.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found Ms. Lumet’s contact information online, and wrote her a letter describing how much I enjoyed her film and whether she plans to write more; I am happy to eagerly await the cinema of anyone who has such a masterful and sensitive understanding of human beings and the constructs they invent around them. There is not a single moment during this film that I felt that something was off, or an event occured that did not fit in the mold of the others. These characters are real people, and this wedding really happened, if only on screen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Ms. Lumet responds, then I will update it here. I hope she is happy to hear that there are people out there who are getting joy from her work, and that her one feature film has deeply affected many people around the world, even thousands and thousands of miles away.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;kokomo&amp;#x2F;kokomo.png&quot;  alt=&quot;kokomo&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Beach Boys&amp;#x27; Mythical Island.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my many moral failings is that I am always on the lookout for books and movies that speak to me at a personal level—I have no doubt that this is a generic human tendency exacerbated by whatever milieu of modernity is being served to us at the moment, but it is one that I display quite extensively. Call it the autofiction disease. In my ideal world we would all be listening to oral recitations of the Odyssey and be fascinated not by Odysseus’s relationship to the self but rather by the sheer entertainment value of how he tricks the cyclops.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I suppose that the entire appeal of the arc with the Sirens is not merely to entertain, but to establish a connection between the reader and Odysseus—the particular strain of narcissism that Odysseus displays in his attempt to listen to the Siren song is the exact same one that makes the story compelling; the objet a here, of course, being your own desire to be strapped to a mast and discover your own mortal sin. More fun than actually listening to the story is your later rumination on what the Sirens would have bode for you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A surprisingly morbid tendency, but it is the same one that makes me really like Nick Hornby’s novel (and the corresponding movie) &lt;em&gt;High Fidelity&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about &lt;em&gt;High Fidelity&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; with some frequency recently, though what I’ve been thinking about doesn’t really have much to do with the previous discussion. In general, I’m not really a “fan” of this book&#x2F;movie—the key nature of what it’s delivering isn’t something that appeals to me all that much, though I would forgive myself for thinking that it does. I mostly like it because the protagonist’s music taste is similar to mine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s also this line:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I listen to pop music because I&#x27;m miserable or am I miserable because listen to pop music?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this line because it endorses my cyclical theory of cause—are you looking into the void, or is the void looking back at you?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’m saying sounds pretentious, but I’m pointing out the obvious fact that if you gravitate towards a certain something, then that something appeals to a certain manner of person that you are, as well, and in order to appeal to you it must inherently be something that reinforces whatever predisposition attracts you to it in the first place.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-beach-boys&quot;&gt;the beach boys&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-beach-boys&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-beach-boys&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that happy pop music has the ability to make people miserable is really just a reflection of how heightened it is in terms of whatever it evokes. I, of course, listen to a lot of pop music—and being the kind of person who is very easily compelled by compelling &lt;em&gt;things&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, I am often quite miserable because of pop music. Fortunately I do have some amount of schadenfreude for my own miserable self. I mean, it’s one thing to feel sad listening to Mount Eerie’s &lt;em&gt;A Crow Looked at Me&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, for instance, which is specifically designed to make you cry, but it’s another altogether to sulk after listening to the Beach Boys for a couple hours. The Beach Boys are one of those bands which cause me to be immediately mistrustful of anyone who doesn’t like them—what do you mean, you don’t like surfing, ocean waves, beaches, California, falling in love? It’s obviously possible to hate all these things, of course, but such hate must extend to the actual pragmatisms of surfing—maybe you hate stepping into the water, for instance, or maybe you have a bone to pick with whatever economic drain Californians cause when they inevitably gentrify your neighborhood, but surely it’s not possible to hate the actual &lt;em&gt;image&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of these things, right? The sheer &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of people lying around on sand and chilling, ignoring the logistics of actually washing it off your feet, or actually attempting to find a place to spread your bath towel? This isn’t just great imagery, it’s the best—and the Beach Boys, God bless them, are all about imagery.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I mean, yeah, after listening to the Beach Boys for a bit my reaction is always something to the effect of: good for &lt;em&gt;them&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but also screw them because they seem to be having a hell of a lot better a time than I am.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, the point is I’ve been listening to &lt;em&gt;Kokomo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a lot, which I hope you’ll forgive me for—I like the Boys but I’m not really an aficionado besides some passing knowledge of the recording of Pet Sounds and SMiLE, and I had no idea that this particular song was written for the 1988 Tom Cruise film &lt;em&gt;Cocktail&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and had no involvement of Brian Wilson at all. I don’t know if the latter fact precludes it from being a ‘real’ Beach Boys single, or whatever, but it’s certainly one of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; favorite songs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;kokomo&amp;#x2F;cocktail.png&quot;  alt=&quot;cocktail&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Cocktail (1988)&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple key aspects here that makes it so good. Very briefly, the song proceeds in the manner of a typical Beach Boys protagonist (a romantic surfer, usually) listing out the variety of places he would like to take his lover.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take ya&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Largo, Montego&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baby, why don&#x27;t we go?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaica&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem (a) is that I genuinely cannot think of a better list of places to visit, period. Like, his first two names are Aruba and Jamaica—that’s already hard to beat, and by the time he’s mentioned Key Largo, it’s over for anyone attempting to make an alternate list. This in itself is thus far an earworm of a chant because it’s so vivid—Mike Love doesn’t even attempt to use actual words to evoke pretty imagery, rather opting simply to list down holiday destinations. This is generally lazy. But in pop music this is precisely what you’re supposed to do—since pop music is intended to communicate the most visceral of emotions its not a problem so much as a strength to be able to maintain a certain giddy simplicity. Take the next few lines:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#x27;ll put out to sea&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we&#x27;ll perfect our chemistry&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By and by we&#x27;ll defy&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of gravity&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afternoon delight&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocktails and moonlit nights&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That dreamy look in your eye&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me a tropical contact high&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way down in Kokomo&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, yeah, that sounds like a great idea. We should be doing that. We should be down in Kokomo, like, right now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous verse was less lazy than just listing down destinations, but it’s still a list, of sorts—here’s all the things things that’re going to be going on when we’re in Kokomo, and he paints a picture of the single most captivating group of seaside activities it’s possible to partake in. That’s what I mean by pop music making people miserable—the average seaside experience is not really close to whatever Love is describing here (which is, crudely, the greatest thing ever), so it’s inherently reinforcing the misery when you compare these larger-than-life experiences with your own; on one hand the song is reminding you of all the possibilities in life, while on the other it’s also giving you a run-through of the kind of things you haven’t experienced, either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verse above reminds me of &lt;em&gt;Girls Like Me&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Slayyyter, who I incidentally went to middle school with:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martinis at the bar&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kissing in the back of your car&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love on the radio&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping you&#x27;re gonna take me home&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit less sophisticated, but it’s still a very suggestive group of activities simply listed out one after the other. This is a common conceit that’s used in pop music, but it’s so good: the fact that these lyrics are so unsubtle is precisely what what causes them to be so riveting. The particular examples I’m giving here are also pretty &lt;em&gt;externally&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; unsubtle. There’s not really a meaningful sense of interiority on part of the singer (or rather the singer within the scope of the song—the protagonist, maybe). It’s really just a bunch of stuff.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Wilson, being a genius, is a lot better at evoking this sort of mesmerizing imagery while also maintaining a far greater sense of emotional depth that transcends his music into something that crosses generations. A song being lyrically hollow doesn’t preclude it from being good—the ones that I mentioned above are really great songs, and &lt;em&gt;Kokomo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a classic, but they are largely limited to eliciting the same kind of emotion on repeated listens. Wilson, on the other hand, seems to be pulling magic out of thin air.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if we were older?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we wouldn&#x27;t have to wait so long&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to live together&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the kind of world where we belong?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean this stuff just makes me cry. Can you believe it? They love each other so much!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation here is so simple, so stripped-down: yes, it &lt;em&gt;would&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; be nice if we were older, wouldn’t it? The sentiment is genuine and universal and borne out of a complete lack of any kind of complex thought—the singer is too embroiled in his love to be capable of such things, and so it’s the perfect subject for a pop song. But Wilson’s genius here is that the sentiment despite being universal is also not &lt;em&gt;hollow&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and he takes full advantage of this later:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know it seems the more we talk about it&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only makes it worse to live without it&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let&#x27;s talk about it&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wouldn&#x27;t it be nice?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse is what I think really transcends the song from a great love song to a bonafide classic. I’m actually not certain how to describe the precise nature of what this particular part of the song does for me. Part of it is that the statement I previously made about complex thought still rings true; these thoughts are complex, yes, but they’re also a natural extension of the previous ones, and not something arrived at through conscious reflection—he’s still in his lovey-dovey dreamy zone when he’s verbalizing them, and the illusion is not broken. On the other hand, this really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a complex philosophical musing, just one that it’s possible to arrive at through merely the act of spending some time with your lover.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;kokomo&amp;#x2F;pets.png&quot;  alt=&quot;pet sounds&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Pet Sounds&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these things are true: the more they talk about it the more it makes it worse to live without it, but he doesn’t want to stop talking about it, either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t really want to talk too much more about the songs off &lt;em&gt;Pet Sounds&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—better to stick to &lt;em&gt;Kokomo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, for now, since due to its simplicity I’m not really being disrespectful to the mystique of the song by subjecting it to this form of analysis. It’s reductive when I apply it to &lt;em&gt;Wouldn’t it be Nice&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. But I think it is true that &lt;em&gt;Wouldn’t it be Nice&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is less successful as a pop song simply because of these new, introduced complexities; it’s not appropriate for party situations that are not intimate, for instance, whereas you can play &lt;em&gt;Kokomo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; pretty much anywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the Beach Boys have a ton of more great pop stuff. I particularly like their proclivity to keep listing a variety of locations:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#x27;d catch &#x27;em surfin&#x27; at Del Mar&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ventura County line&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santa Cruz and Trestles&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#x27;s Narrabeen&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All over Manhattan&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And down Doheny Way&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody&#x27;s gone surfin’&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just another really solid list of places, and there’s a fun anachronism here in that I don’t think Manhattan is actually all that popular of a surfing destination anymore, though clearly in 1963 it was notable enough to be listed along Del Mar or County Line Beach.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, East Coast girls are hip&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really dig those styles they wear&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Southern girls with the way they talk&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They knock me out when I&#x27;m down there&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a bit more complex (but only a bit more) insofar as there’s a list, but it’s accompanied by characteristics—obviously an invitation to continue the song and add your own verses about all the other various kinds of girls you can meet in the USA.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all great, but the perfect marriage of true pop sensibilities and nascent philosophical musings is obviously &lt;em&gt;Good Vibrations&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, the most expensive song ever made at the time:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, I love the colorful clothes she wears&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple enough, but also, like, the things he’s describing really aren’t! The first things you notice about someone aren’t the colorful clothes they wear, or the way the sunlight plays upon their hair.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;kokomo&amp;#x2F;boys.png&quot;  alt=&quot;beach boys&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;It&amp;#x27;s always really funny to me that these guys were just nerds; Dennis was the only one who knew how to surf.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody’s heard this song so I won’t go into details, but it always surprises me that Wilson scrapped his perfect fusion of psychedelia and pop upon listening to the Beatles’ &lt;em&gt;Strawberry Fields Forever&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which, don’t get me wrong, is a great song, but is just way too damn &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to really function as good pop music:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me take you down&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#x27;Cause I&#x27;m going to strawberry fields&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is real&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also doesn’t really lead itself to being sung out of context, but in general it’s not even clear what he’s trying to say (you can look up that he’s referring to the strawberry fields outside his hometown of Liverpool, sure, but that’s cheating—just listening to the song without the accompanying music video it really sounds like he’s just on an acid trip). You have to sit with it for a while before the themes of alienation really begin to sink in—but who the hell is sitting on a pop song for a while? These things are supposed to be disposable mall stuff.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beatles made a lot of good music, but these are all things meant to be heard in the comfort of your own bedroom and not while you’re wearing your baggies out in Santa Barbara. So it’s no surprise that the Beatles’ big pop hit of their later years was &lt;em&gt;Something&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which sonically has the psychedelic undertone of the bassline, but lyrically is exactly what you’d expect it to be:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something in the way she moves&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attracts me like no other lover&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There we go.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;weezer&quot;&gt;weezer&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#weezer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: weezer&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;kokomo&amp;#x2F;weezer.png&quot;  alt=&quot;weezer&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Weezer.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not technically surf rock, Weezer at least petition themselves to be surf rock-adjacent (&lt;em&gt;Island in the Sun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;). Their story has been really played out for a while, at this point: Rivers Cuomo had a moment of brilliance and achieved massive success with their debut &lt;em&gt;Weezer&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (which I’m going to call &lt;em&gt;Blue&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;), following which he went to Harvard, started hating himself and bared out his worst tendencies in &lt;em&gt;Pinkerton&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which was a critical failure and generally considered embarrassing. Then people like me came around, who heard &lt;em&gt;Pinkerton&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and came to the opinion that this is actually really, really good, and that what he’s saying is embarrassing and kind of sucks but it’s very true and so therefore a great source of catharsis. The kicker is that by the time this re-evaluation came around Rivers had started hating himself even more upon reading the critical reviews of &lt;em&gt;Pinkerton&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; following which he nuked his entire sense of authenticity by instead turning around and deciding to partake on a scientific study of pop writing conventions and sincerely sticking to those for the rest of the duration of his life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which led to, of course, &lt;em&gt;Island in the Sun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an island in the sun&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#x27;ll be playin&#x27; and havin&#x27; fun&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it makes me feel so fine&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t control my brain&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is somehow bad. However, it’s not true that whatever pop writing conventions that led to &lt;em&gt;Kokomo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; had been somehow completely exhausted by the time Rivers came around; theres’s an infinite source of these, and whatever magic worked for the Beach Boys &lt;em&gt;should&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, ideally, work for Weezer—except it really doesn’t. This is just not a very good song.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect part of it has to do with the fact that Weezer had shown that they &lt;em&gt;were&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; capable of more—the band was always a pop band, through and through, but even their disposable pop songs carried a level of cheesiness that wasn’t all so immediately apparent as pure slush.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woo-hoo, but you know I&#x27;m yours&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woo-hoo, and I know you&#x27;re mine&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woo-hoo, that&#x27;s for all the time&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look just like Buddy Holly&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you&#x27;re Mary Tyler Moore&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t care what they say about us anyway&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t care &#x27;bout that&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is such a stupid song, but the intimations are cutesy enough that it transforms into a real banger. But this is also a love song in the way that &lt;em&gt;Island in the Sun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; isn’t—and it is true that the best part of &lt;em&gt;Island in the Sun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is also the bridge, which &lt;em&gt;is&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a straightforward love cut:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#x27;ll run away together&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#x27;ll spend some time forever&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#x27;ll never feel bad anymore&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe that’s the problem? Maybe whatever sappy cheesiness that is apt for pop music is only really transformed into the compelling force of nature it can be reigned into if it’s a love song, or deals with subjects beyond just “I’m on an island and I’m really stupid?” But Weezer themselves prove me wrong with their next big single, which I think the jury’s still technically supposed to be out on, but you could never convince me isn’t an absolute nerd classic (and there’s a reason I’m really reproducing the lyrics in full):&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Where I come from isn&amp;#x27;t all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little wack
And my friends are just as screwy as me
I didn&amp;#x27;t go to boarding schools
Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they? I ain&amp;#x27;t nobody
Got nothing in my pocket

Beverly Hills
That&amp;#x27;s where I want to be
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin&amp;#x27; in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Rollin&amp;#x27; like a celebrity
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin&amp;#x27; in Beverly Hills

Look at all those movie stars
They&amp;#x27;re all so beautiful and clean
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between
I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
&amp;#x27;Cause I&amp;#x27;m the next big thing

Beverly Hills
That&amp;#x27;s where I want to be
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin&amp;#x27; in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Rollin&amp;#x27; like a celebrity
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin&amp;#x27; in Beverly Hills

The truth is
I don&amp;#x27;t stand a chance
It&amp;#x27;s something that you&amp;#x27;re born into
And I just don&amp;#x27;t belong
No I don&amp;#x27;t, I&amp;#x27;m just a no-class beat-down fool
And I will always be that way
I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play

Beverly Hills
That&amp;#x27;s where I want to be
(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin&amp;#x27; in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Rollin&amp;#x27; like a celebrity

(Gimme gimme, gimme gimme)
Livin&amp;#x27; in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Yeah, Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weezer-cont-d&quot;&gt;weezer (cont’d)&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#weezer-cont-d&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: weezer-cont-d&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look: I will defend this song until death. Yes, it suffers from the Weezer curse in that it doesn’t really hold up lyrically or melodically compared to the likes of &lt;em&gt;Blue&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Pinkerton&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but the song as it stands isn’t really supposed to be a companion piece to the social and psychosexual alienation of those albums—it’s more so a companion piece to Supertramp’s &lt;em&gt;Breakfast in America&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; or Dire Straits’ &lt;em&gt;Money for Nothing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, both of which have a more vibrant hook, granted, but lack the particular millennium indie-sleaziness of &lt;em&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. That this was written by the guys who made &lt;em&gt;Pinkerton&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; almost contributes to its appeal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that the sheer lack of subtlety in the lyrics above (especially including the cash-money “Gimme gimme, Gimme gimme”) is the exact manner of thought that someone in Rivers’ position would apply—and considering that Rivers himself wrote &lt;em&gt;Blue&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; something like a ten minutes’ drive away from Beverly Hills, also goes to show that this kind of person isn’t a no-class beat-down fool, but rather the kind who would perceive himself to be such. As if the meaningful difference between the groups is a “fashion sense that’s a little wack” or that he “didn’t go to boarding schools!”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even aside from the hilarious classist undertones, that this song works is precisely because of its on-the-nose flavor. It’s weirdly backward: because the unsubtlety reveals the singer to be a narcissistic fool, it’s a lot easier to relate to him as such; a more intellectual treatment would just result in corniness—here there’s an ironic sense in which you can appreciate the singer being privilege-adjacent and therefore myopic, all while acknowledging that this manner of thinking is one the listener is also likely to fall privy to. Whether Rivers did this intentionally, I don’t know, but this really is a Weezer song through-and-through.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&#x27;s going on here?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it that &lt;em&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; works, while &lt;em&gt;Island in the Sun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; doesn&#x27;t? Certainly &lt;em&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x27;s subject matter possesses greater depth: &lt;em&gt;Island in the Sun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is really about nothing, and also just generally feels very stupid. But I suspect the main difference has to be in the leverage these songs take in terms of the &lt;em&gt;interiority&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of the performer: &lt;em&gt;Island in the Sun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; possesses neither the bright imagery of &lt;em&gt;Surfing U.S.A&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which at the very least betrays something about the things the singer chooses to perceive, nor the frustrations of the protagonist of &lt;em&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which even if foolhardy have some amount of meaning. The answer, really, is: who is listening to &lt;em&gt;Island in the Sun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;? What are you gaining from it? There’s not even enough meaning in it to allow your mind to descend into a subliminal dream-state a la &lt;em&gt;Kokomo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—the only biting piece of criticism you even need is Magnet’s “so laid-back it’s practically catatonic.”&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep getting back to this point I’m making about spellbinding lyricism in pop music, but so far I’ve only really talked about the Beach Boys making listicles and Weezer being conceited. What I actually mean is really vivid, embarrassing lines like these by Dua Lipa or the Arctic Monkeys:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One kiss is all it takes&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling in love with me&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibilities, I look like all you need&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m going back to 505&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it&#x27;s a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my imagination, you&#x27;re waitin&#x27; lyin&#x27; on your side&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess in some sense that’s really the point of pop music; verbalizing the embarrassing things that you’re otherwise too self-conscious to state otherwise, and that really is what leads to it being good. Can you believe it? One Kiss is all it takes! Doesn’t that sound incredible? Or: driving back to my stupid motel room, 505, with purpose—wouldn’t it be great if you were there, waiting?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;kokomo&amp;#x2F;fwn.png&quot;  alt=&quot;Favorite Worst Nightmare&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;I wonder what 505 is supposed to be.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has to tie into a broader tendency in pop music, where listening to music is far more &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; an activity than it used to be—the emergence of pop music, really even the concept of pop music really only became meaningful as a denomination once music had widespread availability for individual consumption. In some sense, the art form is an entirely different one from pre-recorded music, which was far more a group activity, or a narrative activity. The primary purpose of recorded pop music these days is to serve as a &lt;em&gt;soundtracking&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; exercise: either as a party backdrop, or being fed into your ear while performing an activity besides sitting and listening patiently to the music; using it as emotional catharsis, for example, or more simply while driving—the experience is less induced by the music and rather it’s that the music forms an integral part of the entire experience. So it makes perfect sense that the lyricism has the leeway to be embarrassing: it’s being consumed individually, and it’s not possible to be embarrassed when you’re alone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s also true in reverse. The things that naturally lend themselves to listening alone are those which are embarrassing, and so embarrassing things are perfect structural elements of pop music.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;abba&quot;&gt;abba&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#abba&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: abba&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this post has dealt with why I find songs which are simple and obvious more compelling as pop music than songs which are complex and introspective (which I also like, don’t get me wrong, but don’t really function as good &lt;em&gt;pop&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; music—music that you turn to when you’re experiencing strong surges of emotions rather than being generally mellow or self-satisfied, or really music that’s on the radio) and my answer was that stark, bright imagery and expressive music along with very obvious but powerful sentiments results in good music. This is the ABBA formula to a T. As one of the GOATs, they possess this pop sentimentalism more than anyone around, but also carry with themselves a pretty powerful talent that’s not as common to find otherwise: the knowledge that the actual &lt;em&gt;content&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of the lyrics doesn’t matter as long as they are expressive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s not a soul out there&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one to hear my prayer&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Won’t somebody help me chase the shadows away?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is harder to explain, I think, since the problem with &lt;em&gt;Island in the Sun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is that it’s basically just devoid of content—the song is about nothing in a bad way. Because this is music, it’s still possible to like and enjoy this song purely melodically, which is fine—I can’t make out a single coherent line Bilinda Butcher is singing on &lt;em&gt;Loveless&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; but I agree with all of them, nevertheless, because the music is so great. But comparing &lt;em&gt;Loveless&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Island in the Sun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is pretty disrespectful, to be honest. &lt;em&gt;Island in the Sun&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has a catchy tune but nothing at all to remotely enrapture you otherwise. On the other hand, &lt;em&gt;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has very enrapturing content—it’s just not content that would seem suitable for a disco song, since it carries such extraordinarily depressing undertones.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;kokomo&amp;#x2F;abba.png&quot;  alt=&quot;abba&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;ABBA&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m not going to claim that this is &lt;em&gt;every&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; ABBA song, the theme is one that runs consistently throughout their poppy discography, resulting in several songs that carry with them the musical quality of an upbeat love song, but simply horrifying lyricism:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look into his angel eyes&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One look and you&#x27;re hypnotized&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#x27;ll take your heart and you must pay the price&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look into his angel eyes&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re in paradise&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one day you&#x27;ll find out he wears a disguise&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#x27;t look too deep into those angel eyes&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no no no no&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gods may throw a dice&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their minds as cold as ice&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And someone way down here&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loses someone dear&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty interesting to me that creating these danceable tunes is really very distinct from imbibing them with appropriate lyrics, but the underlying “appropriateness” is merely the compelling simplicity that they offer and not the actual content of the lyrics. ABBA are probably the most famous for this, but The Police have a knack for taking it to an extreme.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roxanne&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#x27;t have to put on the red light&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roxanne&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#x27;t have to put on the red light&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have as much love for this song as I do for the others in this post, but it’s undeniably catchy (I’m just not as convinced that The Police have aged as well, but then I’m not really close to 40, yet, either—they seem to attract an older audience). It seems to particularly be a recurring trend in ‘80s pop, well-known for being carefree and synth-driven, but not really ‘dark,’ per se; I suspect actually combing through pop lyricism from the ‘80s and comparing it to today’s would yield interesting results. For every &lt;em&gt;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; there’s a &lt;em&gt;Fast Car&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t actually think I’ve seen the introspective&#x2F;simple divide better surfaced than in the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; ‘70s band that consisted of genius couples deriving extraordinary lyricism from their on-off relationships: Fleetwood Mac, with Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie on completely opposite ends of the spectrum. Christine is simple and beautiful, penning what on a good day might be the gun-to-my-head best love song ever written:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh I,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanna be with you everywhere&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Stevie, genius that she is, pens what on a good day might be the gun-to-my-head best breakup song ever written:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a heartbeat drives you mad&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the stillness of remembering what you had&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what you lost&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try dancing a waltz to &lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, though. Even the structure is hard to grasp on first listen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Legitimately one of the best album covers of all time.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a lot of time here ruminating about trends in pop music I enjoy and appreciate, extrapolating and trying to tie it into a central theme of what makes a ‘good’ pop song. However pop music is versatile enough to prove me wrong even in the broadest strokes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#x27;t you tell me to deny it&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve done wrong and I want to suffer for my sins&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve come to you &#x27;cause I need guidance to be true&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I just don&#x27;t know where I can begin&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooh, what I need is a good defense&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#x27;Cause I&#x27;m feeling like a criminal&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I need to be redeemed&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the one I&#x27;ve sinned against&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because he&#x27;s all I ever knew of love&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least &lt;em&gt;Criminal&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has the excuse of being written by an arguably Brian Wilson-level genius. &lt;em&gt;West End Girls&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, on the other hand, I cannot even begin to analyze—I genuinely have no idea what makes it so good, and also what makes it so poppy. This song, despite not even being particularly catchy, is mesmerizing even if you don’t know what a “west end” is, and in some sense even if you know of the concept you don’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; know of it unless you’ve been there—which, for me, was when I was barely conscious.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many shadows, whispering voices&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faces on posters, too many choices&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, when, why, what? How much have you got?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you got it, do you get it&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, how often?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which do you choose&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hard or soft option?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(How much do you need?)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a West End town, a dead end world&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The East End boys and West End girls&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a West End town, a dead end world&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve become interested in switching up my gym routine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;https:&amp;#x2F;&amp;#x2F;matcauthon49.github.io&amp;#x2F;assets&amp;#x2F;blog&amp;#x2F;workout&amp;#x2F;gym.png&quot;  alt=&quot;Planet Fitness&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Planet Fitness, Corvallis.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started working out in the gym around the February of this year, and quickly made a bunch of strength and hypertrophy gains in the first few months with a fairly haphazard program—a 4 day split comprising of alternating push&#x2F;pull days, with interspersed leg exercises based on a combination of whatever I felt like doing and motions given to me by my physiotherapist. In particular, I wasn’t really allowed to squat beyond my bodyweight, since I had undergone ACL reconstruction over the winter and it would take several months for my knee to recover.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My knee eventually did recover, and I gained a few pounds in muscle mass before going on a long cut. Starting in May, I cut about 20 pounds over the summer, going from 155lb to 135lb.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to run again is pretty sweet. I started running over the COVID lockdown as an attempt to lose some weight, but it soon became clear to me that whatever cardio gains it provided were no match for it as a meditative endeavor. When you run your mind is pretty blank and it allows you to really focus on the kind of stuff you’d never think about otherwise—which in my case was the actual music I was listening to while running. It turns out that I have a pretty bad tendency to allow lyrics to fade into the background and simply become another part of the whole experience, and though I can intone songs I’m intimately familiar with, if I’d be forced to sing the actual lyrics the ones I’d guess would be inaccurate, if not made-up. I still don’t think I actually know any of the lyrics on The Replacements’ &lt;em&gt;Let it Be&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, although I can sonically recreate the whole album from memory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I finally went for a run for the first time in three years this July and my fitness had increased to the point where I shattered my previous 5K record. I can now run it in 26:12, which isn’t good, but good enough that sub-20 is now looking like an actual benchmark rather than a long shot.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the losses from my cut were pure body fat percentage—being a newcomer, I was able to retain a significant portion of my gains and also improve my strength in compound lifts like benching and pull-ups. It wasn’t as optimal as I’d like, since I wasn’t able to hit my protein requirements during the cut due to constantly traveling and (briefly) staying in a vegetarian household, but it could’ve been a lot worse.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m now at the point where I’m hoping to make some significant strength gains for about a year or so before my knee recovers to the point where I can get fully back into sports. I can finally squat again, and the previous routine has gotten stale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 days is about as much as I can muster going to the gym—3 always feels a bit low, and at 5 onwards it starts looking like I’m committing to an entirely new form of lifestyle that is inherently at odds with the do-crypto-watch-movies paradigm that has a firm chokehold on me. This rules out a standard P&#x2F;P&#x2F;L, which also has the caveat that 3 straight days in the gym is too tiring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My previous Push&#x2F;Pull workouts were also unfortunately too time-consuming; they were fine when I was deloading while transitioning from my Masters’ to my PhD, but at this point I’m not sure I want to be spending multiple hours in the gym—especially because the city of Paris is significantly more exciting than the city of Corvallis.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My instinct, therefore, is a slightly modified 4-day bro split that proceeds as follows: Push, Legs, Rest, Pull, Misc, Rest, Rest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘standard’ bro split isolates chest and back and shifts arms to a fifth day, but my goals aren’t really to beef up my biceps, and there’s no need to spend a dedicated day on arm exercises. I’d much rather hit spend some time hitting core.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;3x10 push-up progression
3x10 pull-up progression
10 minutes of dedicated skill work
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I’ve been pretty consistent about is spending some dedicated time improving my calisthenics skills.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Push-ups have always been simple for me, and three sets of diamond (or even clap) push-ups is something that I can do without breaking too many sweats. I’m also particularly good at staying in push-up holds for extended periods of time. I’m pretty pumped to transition these to the next level—training one-armed pushups on a staircase, for instance, so it’s a no-brainer to spend some time on these.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t had similar luck with pull-ups. I only ever did a pull-up for the first time this May, and though since then I’ve steadily upped to 3 sets of 5, I’ve hit a plateau over the past few weeks. I’ve tried to power through this by training dead hangs and negatives to failure, but I suspect the real reason why I can’t force myself to the 3x10 I’ve been craving is because of training frequency. Right now, I do pull-ups about 2 times a week, which I doubt is close to enough to progress at the rate I would like to. It makes sense to double this to 4 or even 5 times a week (provided I can get access to a good pull-up bar—I guess I’ll just have to bite the bullet and buy one instead of gentrifying the monkey bars at the park).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been wanting to spend some time dedicatedly training handstands and planches. I’m not terrible at holding a wall handstand, but I’ve never really had the fitness before to maintain it for a significant amount of time. It would be nice to be able to focus on these things during gym time, and not blow off training a handstand in my bedroom before I go to sleep due to arriving home at 3AM.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;push-day&quot;&gt;push day&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#push-day&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: push-day&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;warmup w&amp;#x2F; calisthenics

3x8 incline barbell bench
2xF pec fly
3x8 skullcrushers
2xF tricep pulldowns
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off—no dips. This isn’t an oversight. I’ve been training 3 sets of dips as part of my push day and it’s not that I’m unable to do them, it’s that despite all attempts at form-fixing and even consulting my physiotherapist it’s become clear that there is no solution to the stinging pain I feel in my collarbone after attempting even three, or four. I know that the right muscles are being activated because I can feel it in my pecs and triceps, but the collarbone pain is simply too much to do more than a trivial number of reps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like the diagnosis is microfractures of the collarbone, which are supposed to recede after a month, but this has not been fruitful for me. Furthermore, I don’t feel even close to the same pain while benching. As much as I’d like to keep doing dips it seems that this simply is not an exercise that was meant for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve also been wanting to limit to two exercises per muscle group, which is enough to make steady strength progress without spending hours in the gym. Since I&#x27;ve also already been doing push-ups, this should maintain a significant amount of volume.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flat benching seems to have little to no advantages over incline, and I prefer the range of motion on incline anyway.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of flys, but they are pretty much the best chest isolation I can get without doing another pressing movement. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of training triceps, either, but these exercises are good supplements for the muscles already being worked out on bench.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;legs&quot;&gt;legs&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#legs&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: legs&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;warmup w&amp;#x2F; calisthenics

3x8 squats
3x8 bulgarian split squats
2xF hamstring curl
2xF calf raise
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not particularly opposed to working legs, and indeed I quite enjoy hamstring curls and calf raises—they’re pretty straightforward exercises that don’t carry the total exhaustion of exercises like DLs or Squats.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to return to squats for a while, and I think it’s proven pretty comprehensively at this point that they’re basically the best full-body pressing movement. It’s also not a motion that causes me significant mental effort—they’re certainly exhausting, but the movement itself is quite natural. This is opposed to DLs. I’ve been told to add RDLs to my leg day, but (a) I can’t do RDLs and Squats on the same day, it’s just too taxing, and (b) I don’t like the deadlift motion whatsoever. This is probably the compound lift I least enjoy doing in general; it’s unfortunately just too strenuous for me, and I really don’t want to risk injury. I also get knee scrapes, which I’ve been told is a symptom of poor form, but since I dislike the movement I just don’t want to train it at lower weights without even reaping the full reward.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;pull-day&quot;&gt;pull day&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#pull-day&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: pull-day&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;warmup w&amp;#x2F; calisthenics

3x8 cable row
3x8 barbell row
2xF face pulls
2xF preacher curls
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s always nice to deload a good back day with preacher curls, since it’s a pretty easy isolation that can be done as a cooldown, almost.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are by far some of my favorite exercises to train, especially rows because mentally connecting to your lats always results in the good kind of fatigue and exhaustion that leads to a great sleep at night. I’ve never actually done an upper back exercise, personally—never really felt the need to shrug, or anything—and so it’ll be interesting to test out how these face pulls perform.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;misc&quot;&gt;misc.&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#misc&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: misc&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;warmup w&amp;#x2F; calisthenics

3x8 overhead shoulder press
2xF lateral raises
2xF leg raises
2xF cable crunches
3xF forearm curls
&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal with the final day is to focus on shoulders, core, and the neglected forearms, which are useful for climbing and other calisthenics work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My shoulders are by far my most developed muscle groups, derived from doing a couple sets of lateral raises to failure at the end of every workout since it’s pretty much the simplest exercise to perform mindlessly. It also feels good in the moment—really hits after a couple reps when you feel the traps giving way and the full strength of the side delts coming in. An unexpected consequence of this training is that I was able to master significant reps on pike push-ups without any great deal of difficulty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this day is to also be a bit of a deload after a strenuous back day, and in case I need to skip a workout it can be this one, since all the muscles have been adequately trained through the other workouts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;closing-remarks&quot;&gt;closing remarks&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#closing-remarks&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: closing-remarks&quot; style=&quot;visibility: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m interested in seeing what this particular split can do for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My short-term goal is to gain about 10lb of muscle over the next few months. This should be achievable provided I’m eating well and am consistent with the workout. This should also (hopefully) translate to better calisthenics gains. My ultimate goal is to have a low body fat percentage at 140lb-145lb, which is essentially the optimal for really maximizing my calisthenics and martial arts capabilities, and is a respectable weight for running long-distance, in case I ever want to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I’m hoping that if by around next summer I’m lean at 140lb-145lb, I can instead focus purely on calisthenics and sports without significant worries about strength. This would involve transitioning to a maintenance phase of about a couple medium-effort workouts a week, leaving aside a significant amount of time for other pursuits. I’m hoping that this split can carry me there. If I do chose to return to the gym regularly, I suspect this would be to train more explosive strength and&#x2F;or climbing-related upper-body training.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some good benchmarks to hit include attempting the 225lb bench, which is about 1.6x bodyweight—a pretty respectable benchmark for a seasoned lifter—and a similar squat. These are largely me massaging my ego, however; there’s no reason a good bench translates to being better at the activities I want to do. It’s just a nice number to be able to hit (or to say I’ve hit).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s the full workout, in case you&#x27;re looking for a well-thought out regular split.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR — I have managed to track down a copy of this film, translated it and published full English subtitles for free online.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;珊瑚岛上的死光 (pinyin: shanhu dao shang de shi guang) — known in English as “Death Ray on Coral Island” (dir. Hongmei Zhang, 1980) was the first science fiction film made in post-1949 China, as part of a brief golden age of Chinese science fiction under the early years of Deng Xiaoping. It was adapted from a short story of the same name authored by Tong Enzheng, the first-ever science fiction story published in China’s official literary magazine “Renmin wenxue” (available &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;shanhudaoshangde0000unse&#x2F;&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I am aware, the only ever English translation of the film was as part of MoMA&#x27;s &lt;a class=&quot;mainlink&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.moma.org&#x2F;calendar&#x2F;film&#x2F;3855&quot;&gt;Future Imperfect: The Uncanny in Science Fiction&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; series presented in the summer of 2017, where it was screened with subtitles. MoMA speculates that this was an unofficial North American theatrical release of the film.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have managed to procure this film and published a full translation with subtitles. I suspect that these are the first publicly available English subtitles for the film.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was not done alone: my own Mandarin is limited to “Ni Hao.” I would like to extend my personal thanks to &lt;a class=&quot;mainlink&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;padma.neocities.org&quot;&gt;紅蓮&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (Iris) for a speedy and thorough translation, and to my homegirl &lt;a class=&quot;mainlink&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zhanpeifang.com&quot;&gt;ZP&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for connecting us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking down the film proved surprisingly difficult—all of the private trackers I&#x27;m on did not host it, and I am not really sure where the present recording of the film was produced (it seems to have been recorded by hand, and I would not be surprised if it was captured via recording a projected screen). The film does not seem to have been made available on any Chinese platform such as iQIYI or Youku either. Eventually, like all hidden things on the internet, I was able to follow a (now defunct) link to a VK upload.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full live translation was made by 紅蓮 through simply watching and transcribing the English translation directly into an SRT reader. Once this was done, I was able to watch the film and fix the various timing and presentation issues into a new SRT file through &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nikse.dk&#x2F;subtitleedit&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Subtitle Edit Online&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Of all the various SRT editors I have tried, this one seems to be the best (despite not supporting keyboard shortcuts).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you choose to republish the film with subtitles, here is how I would prefer to be credited:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
